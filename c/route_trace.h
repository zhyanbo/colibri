/* route_trace.h — engine-agnostic routing telemetry: the ROUTE_TRACE stream and the
 * .coli_usage expert history, in one place so every engine emits the same bytes.
 *
 * Why a separate header and not part of telemetry.h: telemetry.h is bound to GLM's
 * structures ("include after Model/Cfg/QT/ESlot/shards ... requires qt_bytes(), now_s(),
 * rss_gb()"), so kimi_k3.c and olmoe.c cannot include it — their Model/Cfg are different
 * types. Routing telemetry does not need shared types: an engine knows its layer index,
 * the expert ids it selected and their gates, and that is the whole input.
 *
 * Dependencies are the C library plus compat.h, and compat.h is NOT optional here: it
 * redirects rename() to MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING), because the CRT rename
 * fails with EEXIST when the destination exists and would therefore silently stop
 * updating the history after its first write on Windows. That shim exists in compat.h
 * *because of* this very code path — see the comment above compat_rename(). Including
 * only <stdio.h> here compiles fine and passes on Linux; it reintroduces that bug.
 * compat.h itself is self-contained (system headers only, no engine types), which is why
 * st.h can include it too.
 *
 * ---- history format (.coli_usage) ----
 * Text, one record per line: "<layer> <expert> <count>", sparse (non-zero only).
 * Two header records carry the dimensions and the writing engine's identity:
 *
 *     -1 <n_layers>       <n_experts>
 *     -2 <format_version> <engine_id>
 *
 * The layer field is NEGATIVE on purpose. Every reader written against the old format is
 * a `while(fscanf(f,"%d %d %u",&l,&e,&c)==3)` loop guarded by `l>=0`, so it parses these
 * two records, discards them, and continues into the data — which is what lets a file
 * written here still load in an engine built before this header existed.
 *
 * Two constraints that field layout is forced by, and they are easy to get wrong:
 *   - a string cannot go in any slot: a non-numeric field makes fscanf return < 3, which
 *     ends the loop and silently drops every record after it. Hence engine_id is a hash.
 *   - engine_id must sit in the THIRD field, the one old readers parse with "%u". A 32-bit
 *     hash routinely exceeds INT_MAX and the second field is read with "%d", where that
 *     is undefined behaviour. So the version (small) goes second, the hash third.
 *
 * Two older layouts are also read, so histories accumulated before this existed keep
 * working — that ranking is the entire value of PIN=auto:
 *   - legacy text: the same triples with no header records. It cannot be validated, so it
 *     is accepted as-is, exactly as before.
 *   - inkling's "IKU1": uint32 {magic, n_layers, n_experts} then a dense
 *     uint32[n_layers][n_experts] block. Only inkling reads it; any other engine refuses
 *     it by name rather than loading another model's ranking.
 *
 * ---- trace format (ROUTE_TRACE=<path>) ----
 * One line per (moe call, batch row): "<call> <row> <layer> <id>:<gate.4f> ...".
 * Byte-identical to what colibri.c emitted before this header; tools/route_pairs.py and
 * the .coli_pairs pipeline consume it unchanged.

/* ---- router safety: a top-k pick that is always a valid expert id ----------
 *
 * Every engine selects experts with the same loop:
 *
 *     int best = -1; float bv = -1e30f;
 *     for (e ...) if (!taken && score[e] > bv) { bv = score[e]; best = e; }
 *     idx[kk] = best;
 *
 * If every candidate score is NaN, no comparison succeeds -- NaN > bv is false
 * for any bv -- and `best` stays -1. It is then used directly as an index.
 * Downstream that becomes score[-1] (heap read), usage[-1]++ (heap write) and,
 * because an expert id also picks a file offset, a pread at a negative offset.
 * In a release build none of that faults: the process finishes and returns
 * wrong numbers over quietly corrupted memory, which is worse than a crash.
 *
 * NaN reaches the router from a corrupt or hostile expert tile, or from an fp
 * overflow at an eviction boundary; c/tests/test_logit_nan.c documents both and
 * hardened only the sampling side, which is downstream of this.
 *
 * colibri.c has carried this guard as a private router_best_or_fallback() since
 * that test was written. inkling.c, kimi_k3.c and olmoe.c never received it --
 * the recurring shape of defects in this tree, a fix that lands in one engine
 * and not its siblings. It lives here now because route_trace.h was the one
 * header all four original engines already included (newer integrated engines
 * inherit it too), and because "which expert did we pick" is exactly what this
 * file is about.
 *
 * Degrading deterministically (to kk, the slot's own index) keeps the selection
 * reproducible and in range; the warning fires once so a poisoned tile is
 * visible without flooding a long generation. */

/* ---- SIGTERM in serve mode: reach rt_save instead of dying before it -------
 *
 * The expert history is written once, after the serve loop returns. A server
 * is not stopped that way: `kill <pid>`, `systemctl stop` and launchd all send
 * SIGTERM, whose default action kills the process outright. The loop never
 * returns, rt_save never runs, and a long serving session contributes nothing
 * to the learned cache -- while one-shot chat mode, which exits on stdin EOF,
 * saves normally. So the data is collected and then thrown away, which is the
 * worst of both. Reported in #1629.
 *
 * The fix is not a save inside the handler. rt_save() allocates and writes a
 * file, neither of which is async-signal-safe, and doing it from a handler
 * that can fire in the middle of the very structures it serialises is how a
 * good history file becomes a corrupt one. The handler only raises a flag and
 * lets the blocking read fail; the loop then exits through the SAME path as
 * stdin EOF, and the existing save at the bottom of main() runs on a quiet
 * process.
 *
 * NO SA_RESTART, deliberately. The serve loop blocks in fgets/getline waiting
 * for the next request. With SA_RESTART the read silently resumes after the
 * handler returns, the flag is set and never looked at again, and
 * `systemctl stop` hangs until its TimeoutStopSec turns into SIGKILL. Without
 * it the read returns NULL/EINTR, which every serve loop already treats as
 * "the gateway is gone" -- the path they take on a clean shutdown. colibri.c
 * carries the same reasoning for its own handler (#810).
 *
 * SIGINT is left alone. On these engines it is still the default, immediate
 * death: making Ctrl-C wait for an in-flight turn, which on a disk-streaming
 * engine is minutes, would read as a hang. colibri.c can afford a soft SIGINT
 * because it can end the current turn; these cannot, so they keep the
 * behaviour their users already expect. */
