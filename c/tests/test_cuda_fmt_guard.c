/* The CUDA generic-decoder format guard, unit-tested WITHOUT a GPU or a CUDA
 * toolchain.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. backend_cuda.cu's weight_at() decoded fmt 0/1/2/4
 * explicitly and then FELL THROUGH to a 2-bit decode for everything else, with
 * no guard. So a tensor in any other format handed to the absorb or
 * grouped-expert kernels came back as plausible numbers derived from reading
 * its bytes two bits at a time. The CPU functions doing the same job on the
 * same tensor -- qt_addrow and qt_matvec_rows in colibri.c -- both exit(1)
 * naming the function and the fmt. Two backends, identical unsupported input,
 * one refusing and one fabricating.
 *
 * weight_at now decodes fmt=3 in an explicit branch and __trap()s on the
 * fall-through, and the host-side gate that keeps unsupported formats off the
 * device reads its admissible set from the SAME predicate rather than
 * restating it (`fmt <= 4`, which also admitted negative fmt). That predicate,
 * coli_cuda_weight_at_supported, is an ordinary C function in backend_cuda.h,
 * so its truth table is checkable on any host -- the same arrangement
 * colibri.c uses for metal_fused_fmt_ok ("Defined unconditionally (not #ifdef
 * COLI_METAL) so the CPU test build can unit-test the truth table").
 *
 * WHAT THIS TEST CANNOT DO, stated rather than implied: it does not execute
 * weight_at, because that is device code. It pins the predicate the host gates
 * consult and the boundary of the set weight_at's explicit branches cover. The
 * device-side __trap() firing on a real launch needs CUDA hardware and is
 * verified there, not here.
 *
 * ENUMERATED, NOT SAMPLED: every fmt value a container can carry (0..8 --
 * qt_resolve_fmt's own documented return set, colibri.c) is asserted by name,
 * plus the out-of-range values a corrupt or hostile descriptor could present. */
