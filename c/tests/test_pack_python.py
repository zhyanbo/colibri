"""tools/pack_python.py's needed() must compute the complete, real set of
files a release archive has to contain: every file coli reaches, by any of
the three kinds of edge, and everything those files reach in turn.

  - import, followed to closure from `coli`
  - subprocess, matched on the `os.path.join(TOOLS, "<script>.py")` call
    shape -- and the script is then walked like any other reached file, so
    what IT imports is followed too
  - data, a file with a data suffix opened next to a module it belongs to

Each edge was added after a published archive was found missing a file:
the hand-written list (#1296), the subprocess boundary, and the data file
(both #1359). The recurring defect is never the value of one case; it is
that the set is computed one way and the truth is another, so each test
below names the real edge it defends rather than an invented one.

Checks enumerated from the source (`tools/pack_python.py`, read in full
before writing this module):

- `local_modules`: root `*.py` files take priority over a `tools/*.py`
  file of the same stem (root added first, `tools/` only via
  `setdefault`).
- `imports_of`: both `import x` and `from x import y` are seen, at any
  nesting (inside a function, after a `sys.path.insert`, inside a `try`)
  -- ast sees them regardless of where in the file they appear.
- `invoked_scripts`: only the exact `TOOLS, "<snake_case>.py"` call-site
  shape is matched; nothing else in the file is mistaken for one.
- `data_files`: a string literal naming a file that EXISTS next to the
  module and carries a suffix from `DATA_SUFFIXES`; a plain name only, so
  a path or a name nothing matches yields nothing, and a source file
  merely mentioned in a message is not mistaken for data.
- `needed`: the import closure starting from `coli`; a script reached by
  subprocess is itself added to the queue so its own imports are
  followed to the same closure, not merely added as a leaf; data files
  are collected along the same walk as leaves; a script invoked but
  missing from `tools/` raises `SystemExit` before anything is returned.

All but one case builds a small, disposable fixture tree with real files.
The exception is deliberate and marked: one test asserts against this
checkout's own `c/` directory, because a fixture can only defend edges
someone already thought of, and the two files #1359 was about are the
evidence that the real tree grows shapes the fixtures do not have."""
