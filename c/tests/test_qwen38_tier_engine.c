/* The qwen38 engine on the fake CUDA backend, driven through its own main().
 *
 * What the tier's unit test (test_qwen36_tier_fp8.c) cannot see is the
 * engine side: that q38_tier_start() brings the tier up from a real FP8
 * fixture (scale banks resident, LUT published, fmt 8), that the decode loop
 * hands qt_note the slab bytes of native slots only, that the reduced CPU
 * list (mask -> cpu_idx/cpu_rank -> batch load) leaves the arithmetic alone,
 * and that recycling the RAM slot right after qt_note corrupts nothing. The
 * fake backend refuses every issue, so the CPU computes all experts and the
 * oracle tokens/logits must still match exactly; the hit/miss counters pin
 * that residency was consulted anyway. Real-GPU parity is a hardware run.
 *
 * Needs ./qwen38_tiny_fp8 (make qwen38-tiny-fp8-generate). Include order as
 * in test_qwen36_tier_int8_engine.c: engine first, then the fake backend,
 * then the tier source, so the tier's statics (G, qs()) are readable here. */
