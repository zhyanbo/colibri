/* coli_cuda_alloc_footprint / coli_cuda_tensor_vram (#687)
 *
 * The expert tier charged `remaining` the LOGICAL byte count of each expert
 * while the allocator was taking more, so auto could claim the card to within
 * a few MiB and then fail every lazy dense upload afterwards. These two
 * functions report what an allocation really costs.
 *
 * Everything here is measured against the live allocator rather than against a
 * rounding rule, because the rounding is a driver and architecture property
 * and a test that hardcoded one card's table would fail on the next.
 *
 * build: nvcc $(GPUFLAGS) backend_cuda.cu tests/test_alloc_footprint_cuda.cu
