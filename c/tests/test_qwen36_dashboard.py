"""The dashboard's Brain and Profile tabs read four lines from the engine's
stdout: EMAP, HITS, PROF, TIERS. On Qwen3.6 they were empty, not because
anything needed activating but because qwen36.c emitted none of them. This
test drives the engine the way the dashboard does -- through `coli serve`
and the /experts and /profile endpoints -- and asserts the data arrives in
the shape the server parses, so a family that stops emitting a line fails
here rather than as a blank tab on a user's screen.

It needs a Qwen3.6 container with a tokenizer.json and a built `qwen36`.
Set COLI_QWEN36_FIXTURE to the container directory; without it the test is
skipped, with the reason on the record. The CI job builds the tiny fixture it
already uses for the token-exact oracle and adds the byte tokenizer from
tools/make_edge_tiny_tokenizer.py, which is all `coli serve` needs.
