 * Pure function -- no Model*, no globals, no I/O -- same testability
 * contract as k3_cap_for_ram/coli_resolve_cap (test_k3_ram_budget.c,
 * test_cap_precedence.c). An explicit cap>0 never reaches this function at

 * "explicit cap always wins" is verified at the integration level
 * (test_qwen36_cap_budget.py), not here. Likewise, RAM_GB parsing itself
 * (getenv/atof) happens in model_init_range, not this function -- an
 * unparseable or negative RAM_GB reaches this function as ram_gb_override<=0
 * (atof's own behavior on garbage input), which is exactly what the
