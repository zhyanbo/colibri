"""`coli stop` must work on platforms without /proc.

`cmd_stop` scanned `/proc` unguarded. On macOS and Windows that directory does not exist, so
`os.listdir("/proc")` raised FileNotFoundError *after* the pidfile target had been collected but
*before* anything was stopped -- and it raised for `--dry-run` too, so there was no safe way to
even inspect what would be killed.

That mattered more than a crash usually does. The docstring on `cmd_stop` explains that the engine
re-execs itself for OMP tuning and therefore does NOT carry the name you started it with, which is
why `pkill -x glm` silently killed nothing and let two ghost engines OOM a box. `coli stop` is the
command that exists to prevent exactly that, and on macOS it could not run at all.

So these tests assert both halves:
  1. the command runs and exits cleanly on this platform;
  2. it still FINDS a `coli serve`-shaped process, i.e. discovery was ported, not merely guarded.
