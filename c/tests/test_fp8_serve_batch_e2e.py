"""Defect-closure pin for the batched-serve fmt=8 abort (D-I2): two-slot
SERVE_BATCH mux against a REAL fp8 (fmt=8) `kv_b_proj` container.

The defect: batched serve mode (openai_server's Engine always launches the
engine with SERVE_BATCH=1; --kv-slots > 1 gives the mux real slots) decodes
kv_b through the MLA absorb path -- qt_addrow / qt_matvec_rows in colibri.c.
Before the fmt=8 absorb branches landed, those functions had no fp8 case:
the first generation request against a container whose kv_b_proj resolves to
fmt=8 (fp8-e4m3-b128 -- both production fp8 container classes, f8_full and
f8x4g64, are in this class) killed the engine with the named refusal

    qt_addrow: unsupported fmt=8 for the per-row-scale absorb path ...
    -- refusing rather than misread t->s[row]/t->q4

and the client saw a 500 `engine_error`.  Single-stream chat never hit it,
so nothing in the FakeEngine-backed server suite could: the abort lives
below the engine wire protocol, on a code path only a real fmt=8 container
reaches.  This test pins the closure end to end: serve the real container
batched, occupy BOTH KV slots concurrently, and require 200 + text on both
requests with the engine still alive afterwards.

A real fmt=8 container is hundreds of GB and exists only on the model
hosts, never in CI, so discovery is by environment variable:

    COLI_FP8_CONTAINER   root of an engine-loadable container whose
                         kv_b_proj is fp8 (fmt=8).  Unset => named SKIP.
    COLI_ENGINE          engine binary override (same convention as coli);
                         default: the built `colibri` next to the server.
                         SET but wrong => loud FAIL, never a skip.
    COLI_FP8_EXPECT_BITE=1   proof-of-bite mode for the fleet's old-binary
                         half: the run PASSES only if the invocation FAILS
                         to serve AND the captured server stderr carries
                         the named `unsupported fmt=` refusal.  A death
                         without the refusal, or a clean serve, FAILS.
    COLI_FP8_READY_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for the server to come up
                         (default 1800 -- container loads are large).
    COLI_FP8_GENERATE_TIMEOUT   seconds per generation request (default
                         1800; two concurrent cold prefills on a
                         storage-bound host can be slow).

Set-but-wrong is a FAILURE, not a skip: if COLI_FP8_CONTAINER names a
missing path, a container whose kv_b_proj is NOT fmt=8 (e.g. an int8
spine), or a shard set with duplicate tensor names, this test would
otherwise pass (or fail for the wrong reason) without ever entering the
absorb branch it exists to pin -- the vacuous-gate hazard.  The safetensors
headers are checked first (pure header reads, no tensor data) and the
mismatch is a loud failure naming what was found.  The same doctrine covers
COLI_ENGINE: a set-but-nonexistent engine path fails, it does not skip.
(Known unreachable corner: a shape with O == ceil(O/128)*ceil(I/128) makes
per-row and per-block scale counts collide and the unstamped loader would
resolve fmt=1 where this check says fmt=8 -- real GLM kv_b O is in the
thousands, so no planned container can reach it.)

The engine/server child environment is constructed fresh: ambient COLI_*
and engine-knob variables (KV8, KV_TQ, ...) are stripped except an
explicit backend/location allowlist plus two value-restricted knobs --
exactly ABSORB=0 (the ratified non-absorb fleet arm; any other ABSORB
value is stripped), and exactly COLI_CUDA_ATTN=1 WHEN the lane opts in
with COLI_FP8_E2E_CUDA_ABSORB=1 (default: stripped, so a leaked ambient
COLI_CUDA_ATTN can never swap the code path under test) -- and a leaked
COLI_API_KEY cannot 401 the ready poll; the kept/dropped set is printed
and attached to every failure so the run artifact shows the env the
invocation actually saw.

Lane semantics, stated exactly: by DEFAULT every lane (CPU or CUDA host)
exercises the CPU absorb arms -- the CUDA fmt=8 absorb decode is gated
on COLI_CUDA_ATTN (path selection) AND CUDA_DENSE (kv_b's
cuda_eligible), both of which this test strips unless the lane
explicitly opts in.  A CUDA lane that sets COLI_FP8_E2E_CUDA_ABSORB=1
(plus its COLI_CUDA/COLI_GPU bindings and ambient COLI_CUDA_ATTN=1 and
CUDA_DENSE=1) pins the CUDA absorb decode end-to-end, and the test then
REQUIRES the engine's GPU-dense boot line as a witness -- an opt-in run
whose engine reports resident-dense-on-CPU fails rather than banking a
vacuous green.  Without the opt-in, the CUDA absorb arm is pinned only
by tests/test_backend_cuda.cu.
