/* olmoe matmul_q: the IDOT path must be compared against FP32 ACTIVATIONS,
 * not against an integer reference.
 *
 * This is the test gap behind issue #1044. tests/test_idot.c asserts that the
 * integer dot kernel matches a plain-C integer reference, which it does --
 * exactly, because integer arithmetic has no rounding. But matmul_q's IDOT
 * branch quantizes the ACTIVATIONS to Q8_0 per 16-element block before calling
 * that kernel, and the scalar fallback does not. Comparing int8 against int8
 * can never see that. So a lossy path shipped as the default on every AVX2
 * machine (since 2c4e9de) with a green test suite.
 *
 * What this file asserts:
 *   1. the scalar fallback is EXACT against an fp64 reference;
 *   2. the IDOT path is NOT exact, and its error sits at the magnitude the
 *      activation quantization predicts (~1e-3 relative, not ~1e-7);
 *   3. IDOT is OPT-IN: with the variable unset, matmul_q takes the exact path.
 *
 * (2) is deliberately a two-sided bound. Asserting only "error is small" would
 * pass if someone silently made IDOT exact, and asserting only "error exists"
 * would pass if it got much worse. Both directions are load-bearing: the point
 * is that the two paths DIVERGE and by how much.
 *
 * Build: make -C c tests/test_olmoe_matmul_q
