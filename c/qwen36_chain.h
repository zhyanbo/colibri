/* qwen36_chain.h -- Qwen3.6's layers as a dense chain on the Vulkan device (vk_chain.h).
 * Included once by qwen36.c in a COLI_VULKAN build, after the CPU forward it stands in
 * for; COLI_VK_CHAIN decides (backend_vulkan.c, coli_vk_chain_decide).
 *
 * What runs where, per layer, for one block of rows (decode: one row):
 *   device, frame A1: the routed MoE output of the layer before joins the residual
 *     (x += routed + gate * shared, chain_ew COMBINE, the CPU's order), the input
 *     RMSNorm, then either the gated attention (q/k/v, per-head q/k norm, RoPE from a
 *     host table, the K/V rows into the device cache, attention with the output gate,
 *     o_proj) or the Gated DeltaNet (qkv/z/b/a, the convolution with its ring, the
 *     recurrence with its state, the gated norm, out_proj), the residual add, the
 *     post-attention RMSNorm and the router logits. Then the frame is waited for.
 *   host: the router's softmax and top-k, the routed experts (the Vulkan expert tier's
 *     device batch and the CPU's share, joined in rank order: moe_ex routed_only), the
 *     K/V rows copied into the host cache.
 *   device, frame A2 (not waited for): the shared expert and its gate, while the host
 *     computes the routed experts.
 * Crossing per layer: the normalized rows (D floats per row) and the router logits
 * (E per row) down, the K/V rows of an attention layer down, the routed sum (D per
 * row) up. A dense model (no routed experts) records the whole forward in one frame.
 * The last frame normalizes the last row and runs lm_head; its logits come back.
 *
 * State and who owns it:
 *   - the residual stream: on the device for the whole forward;
 *   - the attention KV cache: the host's stays canonical (every chain step copies its
 *     new rows back), the device holds a mirror with a watermark per layer, kv_valid:
 *     rows [0, kv_valid) equal the host's. A step that starts at pos_base uploads the
 *     rows [kv_valid, pos_base) first; a CPU step lowers the watermark to its
 *     pos_base; a cache that grows (ensure_kv) is mirrored again from the host;
 *   - the DeltaNet recurrent state and conv ring: on the device while the chain runs
 *     (60 MB on the 35B: too much to copy per token). dn_where says which side holds
 *     the newest copy; the host one is brought back before anything reads it there
 *     (a CPU step, a pinned snapshot) and pushed up after anything writes it there
 *     (reset_recurrent: a fill with zeros on the device, pin_restore: an upload).
 * Prompt-cache and prefix reuse need nothing more: a reused prefix is rows below the
 * watermark and a DeltaNet state that already sits where the next step expects it.
 * A speculative verify (prompt lookup, q36_spec_step) runs here too: its matrices take
 * the per-row GEMV (a decode step's bits), lm_head reads each of its rows, and the
 * DeltaNet state and conv rings are copied on the device after each of its rows but the
 * last, one slot per row (the recurrent ops split into one dispatch per copy, each
 * ending on its row: the same bits), so a draft rejected after row r rolls back by
 * swapping slot r's buffers in (q36c_rollback).
 *
 * Past the device's budget (vk_kvsplit.h) each attention layer keeps only a window of
 * the newest positions on the device; the step's attention runs over that window on
 * the device and over the older positions on the CPU (from the host's canonical cache)
 * at once, the two merged through their softmax statistics. Below the budget the
 * mirrors are whole, as above.
 *
 * The chain declines (the per-matrix path runs, state synced first) under the CUDA
 * expert tier, a qpack container, PILOT prefetch, or geometry outside its shaders
 * (head dim > 256, DeltaNet value head > 128, key head > 256, conv kernel > 9).
 * A device lost while the chain holds the recurrent state: the engine rebuilds that
 * state on the CPU from the prefix record (the ids it was built from; the KV rows are
 * the host's already), stays on the CPU, and the step runs there. Only a state that
 * the ids do not describe (an image) cannot be rebuilt: that stops the engine.
 * COLI_VK_CHAIN_FAULT=n (vk_chain.c) fakes the loss at the n-th frame, for tests.
 *
 * A partial chain (vk_chain.h, vkc_fit; docs/vulkan.md, "A partial chain"): when the
 * layers do not all fit the device, the chain takes layers 0..N-1 and the CPU the rest
 * and the head. q36c_start decides N at start, before any upload and before the tier
 * sizes its budget; q36c_setup then places the N layers there and then, one layer at a
 * time (a layer that fails is freed whole and N stops before it), and with the dense
 * weights on the device only drops each layer's host copies once the layer is there.
 * The matrices of the CPU's layers (and of the head, unless the fit puts it up) are
 * marked vk_off: the per-matrix path never uploads them. A forward runs the N layers
 * on the device chunk by chunk as above, brings the residual rows after layer N-1 back
 * to the host once per chunk, and returns; the caller runs layers N..L-1 over all the
 * rows on the CPU (layer by layer, as without the chain) and the head. The device's
 * layers keep their state on the device (KV mirrors, the DeltaNet state and its verify
 * copies), the CPU's layers on the host (their KV rows, DeltaNet state and the CPU's
 * verify snapshots); every loop over layers here runs over the N. A device lost
 * mid-forward rebuilds the N layers' recurrent state from the prefix record: the CPU's
 * layers have not run that forward yet, so theirs is already the host's. */
