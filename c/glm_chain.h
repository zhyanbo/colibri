/* glm_chain.h -- GLM-5.2's layers as a dense chain on the Vulkan device (vk_chain.h).
 * Included once by colibri.c in a COLI_VULKAN build, after the CPU layer forward it
 * stands in for; COLI_VK_CHAIN decides (coli_vk_chain_decide, this engine's integrated
 * GPU default COLI_VK_CHAIN_UNMEASURED: off, not measured on a GLM checkpoint).
 *
 * What runs where, per layer, for one block of rows (decode: one row):
 *   device, frame A1: the routed MoE output of the layer before joins the residual
 *     (x += routed + shared, chain_ew COMBINE: the CPU's order), the input RMSNorm, the
 *     MLA attention (vkc_mla_qkv: q_a, its norm, q_b, kv_a, the latent norm, RoPE on
 *     the rotated dims, the new latent and rope rows into the device cache; the DSA
 *     indexer on a full layer: the index key (wk, LayerNorm, RoPE) into its cache and,
 *     once the context passes index_topk, every row's top-k (vkc_dsa_select), reused by
 *     the shared layers after it; vkc_mla_attn: the absorbed core over the cache or the
 *     selection, the value rows, o_proj), the residual add, the post-attention RMSNorm.
 *     A dense layer (the first first_k_dense_replace) runs its MLP here too and has no
 *     host step. Then the frame is waited for.
 *   host: the router (moe() reads the normalized rows: its f32 router, sigmoid, bias,
 *     top-k, every routing option it has) and the routed experts (the Vulkan expert
 *     tier's device batch and the CPU's share), without the shared expert; the new KV
 *     rows copied into the host's cache.
 *   device, frame A2 (not waited for): the shared expert, while the host computes the
 *     routed experts.
 * Crossing per sparse layer: the normalized rows (D floats per row) and the new KV rows
 * (kv_lora + qk_rope, and index_head_dim on a full DSA layer) down, the routed sum (D per
 * row) up. The final rows come back to the host, which runs the final norm and lm_head as
 * before (step, step_all and the teacher-forced pass all read them from there).
 *
 * State and who owns it:
 *   - the residual stream: on the device for the whole forward;
 *   - the KV cache (latent, rope key, DSA index keys): the host's stays canonical (every
 *     chain step copies its new rows back), the device holds a mirror per layer behind a
 *     watermark, kv_valid: rows [0, kv_valid) equal the host's for the KV state `owner`.
 *     A step from pos_base uploads [kv_valid, pos_base) first. Every host write lowers it:
 *     the CPU's attention (glmc_cpu_rows, at attention_rows' head), kv_alloc
 *     (glmc_kv_reset), a slot adopting another's rows (glmc_host_rows), a different KV
 *     state bound (the owner check). The mirror grows with the context (powers of two
 *     up to the host's max_t), and a grown mirror is filled again from the host.
 * Past the device's budget (vk_kvsplit.h) each layer keeps only some blocks of its
 * latent and rope rows on the device: the window of the newest, and the blocks the DSA
 * selection reads most. The attention core then runs over those on the device and over
 * the rest on the CPU (from the host's canonical cache) at once, merged through the
 * softmax statistics; the index keys, which every row scores every step, stay whole.
 * MLA has no recurrent state: a rejected draft is rows the next step rewrites, prefix
 * reuse is rows below the watermark, and a device lost mid-forward leaves nothing to
 * rebuild: the forward runs again on the CPU from its input rows (still on the host)
 * and the CPU runs from there (COLI_VK_CHAIN_FAULT=n fakes the loss at the n-th frame).
 * The layers already done in the lost forward count their experts' routing twice in
 * the usage statistics.
 *
 * KV_SLOTS' batched decode (several conversations, a row each at its own position) runs
 * on the chain too (glmc_forward_rows): the batch's matrices as one, each row's attention
 * over its own conversation's mirror (the chain's own, or one of up to COLI_VK_CHAIN_MUX
 * beside it, whole, each with its watermarks; the one read longest ago gives way) and its
 * own DSA list. Such a step stays on the CPU with the split on, past the mirrors' count
 * or the device's room, and with COLI_VK_CHAIN_MUX=0.
 *
 * The chain declines (the CPU path runs, the watermark follows) for a layer range
 * (segments), a quantized KV cache (KV8, KV_TQ),
 * PILOT or LOOKA (they read the residual on the host between layers), the exact verify
 * of COLI_EXACT_VERIFY, the CUDA backend, and a model whose matrices or geometry its
 * shaders do not take (int2, E8/IQ3, fp8 dense matrices; kv_lora above 1024, qk_rope
 * above 128, qk_nope above 1024; an indexer above 64 heads or 4096 query floats). The
 * MTP head runs on the CPU, as before: its own KV row is not mirrored.
 *
 * A partial chain (vk_chain.h, vkc_fit; docs/vulkan.md, "A partial chain"): when the
 * device's free memory does not hold every layer, the chain takes layers 0..N-1 and the
 * CPU runs N..L-1, the final norm and lm_head (and the MTP head, eh_proj and lm_head stay
 * on the host unless the whole chain and that tail fit). N is decided at startup, before
 * any upload and before the pins and the RAM cap (glmc_start, from colibri.c's main right
 * after the load); with COLI_VK_DENSE_HOST only the N layers give their host copies back,
 * each once all of it reached the device. A forward runs every chunk of its rows through
 * the N device layers, then hands the rows to the CPU's layer loop from layer N. The
 * crossing: the residual rows (D floats a row) and, when layer N reuses a DSA selection
 * (a shared indexer layer after a full one on the device), that selection (1 + index_topk
 * ints a row), once per chunk. The device's KV mirror, its watermarks and the KV split
 * cover the N layers; the CPU layers' rows are the host's alone. */
