"""fmt=8 repack tool: Z.ai GLM-5.2-FP8 shards -> the engine's native-FP8-passthrough
container (byte-preserved, no dequant/requant).

fmt=8 is a PUBLIC ordinal. This tool's output format was minted fmt=6 during
this branch's original development, before dev's own #465 (E8/IQ3) claimed
that ordinal upstream and merged it into dev as a REAL fmt=6 (colibri.c's
qt_resolve_fmt, quant.h's E8 constants); re-tagged fmt=100 (PRIVATE ORDINAL
BLOCK, see colibri.c's QT struct comment) from that point forward -- this
tool has never emitted a container claiming ordinal 6 -- graduated to fmt=7
when the maintainer assigned that ordinal on #524, and renumbered to fmt=8
after #705 merged MXFP4 as fmt=7 while this PR was open. Nothing this tool
writes carries the ordinal, so neither renumber changed its output bytes.

Unlike convert_fp8_to_int4.py (which DEQUANTIZES fp8 -> f32 -> REQUANTIZES to a
different, lossy format), this tool copies the fp8 weight bytes AS-IS and only
renames/reshapes the scale sidecar to the engine's `.qs` convention. Same 8
bits/weight streaming cost as the source, zero additional quantization loss.

THE DESIGN LANDMINE (see qt_resolve_fmt in colibri.c, c/quant.h's E4M3_LUT
comment): the engine tells fmt=8 (this tool's output) apart from fmt=1 (plain
int8) ONLY by scale-array geometry -- per-row for fmt=1, per-128x128-block for
fmt=8. This tool must therefore emit .qs sidecars whose byte count is EXACTLY
ceil(O/128)*ceil(I/128)*4, and must never emit one that could coincide with
O*4 for a tensor whose read-side resolution has no other evidence to go on --
ENFORCED, not just asserted, by _check_geometry below (maintainer review,
#528). This is not hypothetical: GLM-5.2's own self_attn.o_proj.weight
([6144,16384]) is a real instance (nblkO=48, nblkI=128, product=6144==O), and
the collision census over the whole checkpoint finds it is the ONLY ambiguous
2-D fp8 family there.

WHAT DECIDES THE COLLISION, and what changed: the engine's UNSTAMPED read-side
policy resolves an ambiguous shape to fmt=1 rather than refusing (see
qt_resolve_fmt's INVERSION) -- so an UNSTAMPED fmt=8 tensor at such a shape
would be silently read back as plain int8, with no read-side refusal to catch
it. A STAMPED one is different, and always has been: qt_resolve_fmt's
"THE STAMPED CASE IS UNCHANGED by this inversion" branch resolves a tensor
whose __metadata__ stamp names exactly one of the two colliding candidates
through the existing TRUST-VERIFY-REFUSE path. So the write-side rule is not
"never emit at the collision shape" but "never emit at the collision shape
UNSTAMPED" -- the invariant #528 asked for, stated at the precision the
mechanism actually has. _check_geometry therefore takes a `stampable` flag and
refuses when it is false; _emission_stamp_gate below re-derives BOTH halves of
that question from the OUTPUT TENSORS THEMSELVES immediately before the bytes
hit disk -- the collision predicates from the emitted weight's [O,I] and its
emitted .qs LENGTH, and stampability from the tensor NAME (not from the map the
selection side built) -- so the guarantee is structural (a property of what is
written) rather than procedural (a property of how the callers happen to be
wired). The one axis the emitted bytes cannot answer, an unrecognized name that
is neither routed nor an audited resident, is closed on the selection side by
STAMPABLE_KINDS instead.

WHICH TENSORS ARE STAMPABLE is a READER-side fact, not a writer's choice. Only
qt_from_disk consults the stamp map; the three routed-expert load sites
(expert_load_impl and friends, colibri.c) call qt_resolve_fmt with
stamped_name=NULL, so a stamp on a routed expert would be written and never
read. docs/FORMATS.md states the same thing from the registry's side ("the
routed-expert load sites ... pass stamped_name=NULL, so the MANDATORY stamp is
not consulted there today"), and st.h's ST_FMT_STAMP_MAX cap is sized on the
same premise (stamps are "NEVER the tens of thousands of routed-expert tensors
a large MoE model carries"). Routed experts are therefore emitted UNSTAMPED
and stay subject to the unconditional collision refusal.

The same reader-side standard applies in the other direction: a tensor is
stampable only if a load site was actually audited for it. classify()'s "q" is a
CATCH-ALL for any unmatched name ending ".weight", so no particular load site
corresponds to it -- it is repacked but not stampable (see STAMPABLE_KINDS),
which means an unexpected tensor from some checkpoint variant is refused loudly
at the collision shape rather than emitted under a stamp resting on a fallback.

At I=98 specifically, a single-block fp8 tensor's raw weight-byte count ALSO
coincides with a genuine fmt=6 (E8/IQ3) tensor's -- see qt_resolve_fmt's
"SECOND DESIGN LANDMINE" comment. That collision is resolved read-side by a
stamp naming fp8-e4m3-b128 (qt_resolve_fmt's `sf==8 && fp8_blk_f32_also`
branch) and refuses unconditionally without one. Z.ai's real projections do
not land at I=98, but this tool now also emits routed experts, which are
unstampable -- so _check_geometry guards that shape for unstampable tensors
too, refusing at write time rather than emitting a container that would refuse
at load time.

SCALE ENCODING: this tool always emits f32 block scales (4 bytes/block, the
`.to(torch.float32)` below) -- the ENCODING this build implements. It never
reads or emits a UE8M0 (1 byte/block) sidecar: Z.ai's GLM-5.2-FP8 checkpoints
ship f32 `weight_scale_inv`, so there is no source data this tool would need
to convert from. A DeepSeek-V4-shaped source (same weight geometry, UE8M0
scales) is out of scope for this tool as written; the read side (qt_resolve_fmt)
recognizes and refuses that byte signature by name rather than misread it,
should a container carrying it ever reach the engine some other way.

SELECTED kinds (fp8-repack path): "resident" tensors (shared expert, o_proj,
kv_b_proj, other attention projections, dense-MLP first layers, and the
generic resident fallback) AND routed experts (kind "x" in
convert_fp8_to_int4.classify). Routed experts were
previously excluded and left on the int4-g64 streaming path; they are the bulk
of a GLM-5.2 checkpoint's fp8 bytes, so byte-preserving them is the point of
minting from the authoritative checkpoint at all. They differ from residents in
exactly one respect this tool has to honour: they are never stamped (see WHICH
TENSORS ARE STAMPABLE above), so their format is decided by byte arithmetic
alone and _check_geometry keeps the unconditional collision refusal for them.
The engine's CPU routed-expert path dispatches them correctly -- expert_ffn ->
expert_gate_up/matmul_qt (colibri.c), whose fmt==8 branch calls matmul_fp8;
the CUDA grouped-expert path refuses fmt>3 host-side and falls back to that CPU
path rather than mis-decoding them.

FULL-FAMILY EMISSION (M1 mint coverage audit, 2026-08-18): routers/norms/bias
(kind "f32") and embed/lm_head (kind "io", BF16 or F32 in source, never FP8)
are now copied byte-identically into the container -- see is_passthrough_target
and PASSTHROUGH_KINDS below. This is a pure pass-through, not a repack: no
`.qs` sidecar, no stamp, no `_check_geometry` involvement, dtype unchanged. It
is exactly the code path the engine already runs today against a raw,
unrepacked source directory (`ld`/`qt_from_disk`'s fallback to `st_read_f32`
when no `.qs` sidecar exists, colibri.c) -- nothing new is exercised on the
read side. `main()` also copies `config.json` (mandatory, colibri.c's
load_cfg) and `generation_config.json` (best-effort) from --indir into
--outdir. Together with kv_b_proj emission below, this makes the tool's
output a standalone-loadable model directory on its own: both halves of the
engine-side absorb support (CPU and CUDA) exist -- see below.

kv_b_proj (kind "kvb") is now emitted the same way as o_proj/attn: byte-
preserved fp8 weight + renamed `.qs` scale sidecar, stamped (it clears the
collision shape the same way o_proj does -- M1 audit, GLM-5.2's kv_b_proj is
never at the ambiguous [O,I] this tool's `_check_geometry` guards). The
engine side of this two-sided integration now exists on both backends:
colibri.c's MLA-absorption path (qt_addrow/qt_matvec_rows, called only on
l->kv_b) carries explicit fmt==8 decode arms, and the CUDA absorb kernels
decode fmt=8 through weight_at/absorb_scale (admitted by
coli_cuda_weight_at_supported, uploads gated on the published e4m3 LUT).
A container minted here loads clean (qt_from_disk resolves the stamp
exactly like o_proj's) and decodes correctly through the batched
(`kvs`-nonNULL) serving path, where absorb cannot be bypassed.

METADATA STAMP (reference implementation of the FORMATS-registry FR -- see
docs/FORMATS.md): every output shard's safetensors `__metadata__` carries a
`colibri.fmt` key whose VALUE is itself a JSON-encoded object mapping each
stamped tensor's exact name to its format NAME string (FORMAT_NAME below,
"fp8-e4m3-b128" -- never the internal fmt=8 ordinal, which the container must
never depend on, see colibri.c's QT struct comment). The reader
(qt_from_disk's qt_verify_fmt_stamp, colibri.c) is TRUST-VERIFY-REFUSE: a
stamp that agrees with the byte-arithmetic inference is a no-op (the tensor
loads exactly as it would unstamped); a stamp that disagrees, or names a
format this build doesn't recognize, is refused loudly (same "untrusted
container" discipline as qt_resolve_fmt's own THE DESIGN LANDMINE refusal).
What a stamp additionally lets resolve differs by collision (FIX ROUND 2:
corrected a stale pre-INVERSION description here -- see qt_resolve_fmt's own
documentation for the exact rule in both cases): for the fmt=6-vs-fmt=8
collision, an unstamped tensor at that shape still refuses unconditionally --
a stamp naming the correct candidate resolves it instead, as originally
designed. For the fmt=1-vs-fmt=8 collision, the INVERSION (maintainer review,
#528) means an unstamped tensor at that shape no longer refuses at all -- it
resolves to int8-row by default -- so a stamp's role there is letting a
genuinely-stamped fmt=8 tensor still be read as fmt=8 (overriding that
default), not resolving a refusal that no longer happens. Unstamped
containers (any container from a tool that doesn't stamp, including every
container this tool itself has ever produced before this feature existed)
are otherwise unaffected: no stamp means byte-arithmetic inference alone
decides, exactly as it always has.

CONTAINER-LEVEL FORMAT DECLARATION: every output shard's `__metadata__` also
carries a `colibri.container.formats` key whose VALUE is JSON text -- a sorted
array of the format NAME strings this container declares it carries residents
in (today: exactly ["fp8-e4m3-b128"]). It is a CONTAINER-wide statement, not a
per-tensor one, and it is deliberately INERT in this revision: no engine reads
it. Its purpose is the hole the per-tensor stamp cannot close by itself -- if
any downstream tool rewrites shards without preserving `__metadata__`, a
stamped fmt=8 tensor at the collision shape silently becomes an unstamped one
and resolves to int8-row with no error. A container that DECLARES fp8-e4m3
residents gives a reader the standing to treat an unstamped ambiguous tensor
inside it as an ERROR instead of an int8 default, which converts a procedural
guarantee back into a structural one. The engine-side check is separate work;
containers minted now carry the declaration so that check has data to act on
from the day it lands. Unknown `__metadata__` keys are ignored by the existing
reader (st_fmt_stamp_ingest looks up "colibri.fmt" alone, and st_init_multi
skips the whole "__metadata__" entry when indexing tensors), so an engine that
does not know this key loads such a container exactly as it does today --
verified by tests/test_fp8_e2e_repack_load.py.

HEADER METADATA ORDER (fixed 2026-08-18, see
colibri_lab/reports/D1_MINT_DIVERGENCE_2026-08-18.md and
colibri_lab/reports/F2_MINT_DETERMINISM_FIX_2026-08-18.md): shards this tool
emitted BEFORE this fix can differ from a re-mint of the same checkpoint in
the byte order of the two keys inside `__metadata__` ("colibri.fmt" vs
"colibri.container.formats") -- a property of the underlying safetensors
`save_file` extension, which does not preserve Python-side dict order when
serializing its `metadata=` argument. This affects ONLY those two header
bytes' relative position; every tensor payload byte, every `data_offsets`
value, and both metadata VALUES are unaffected and were always correct (D1's
diagnosis closed the corruption question directly). A raw whole-file SHA-256
comparison between two containers minted from the same input before and
after this fix -- or between two pre-fix mints -- can therefore show a
mismatch that is entirely this cosmetic reordering, not a faithfulness
regression; compare tensor payload hashes (or `__metadata__`'s parsed JSON
values) rather than raw file digests when checking such pairs.
`_canonicalize_metadata_order` (this module) makes every container minted
FROM THIS FIX ONWARD byte-identical for byte-identical inputs, including
across repeated runs and across machines -- see
tests/test_fp8_repack.py's determinism test.

HARD CONSTRAINT for this build: unit-tested on synthetic fixtures ONLY (see
tests/test_fp8_repack.py, built with tools/glm_fp8_emit.py's exact real-
checkpoint layout) plus --dry-run inventory mode against those same fixtures.
NO read of any real Z.ai shard, NO full or partial repack of a real checkpoint

    scale byte count (O*4) -- an UNSTAMPED fmt=8 tensor is silently read back as
    fmt=1, because the reader's INVERSION resolves an unstamped collision to the
    incumbent decodable format rather than refusing. A STAMPED one is not: the
    reader's "THE STAMPED CASE IS UNCHANGED by this inversion" branch resolves it
    through TRUST-VERIFY-REFUSE, which is what the stamp mechanism exists for.
    GLM-5.2's own self_attn.o_proj.weight ([6144,16384]) is a REAL, non-
    hypothetical instance of this shape, and the census over the whole checkpoint
    finds it is the only one -- so `stampable` is what separates "emit it, stamped"

    trusts the caller to have classified the tensor correctly and to actually put
    the promised stamp in fmt_map. This gate re-derives BOTH halves of the
    question from the OUTPUT TENSORS THEMSELVES: the collision predicates from the
    emitted weight's [O,I] and its emitted `.qs` LENGTH (which is what the reader
    actually counts -- ns == O*4 bytes, i.e. len(.qs) == O), and stampABILITY from
    the tensor NAME via _reader_consults_a_stamp, not from the map _stampable()
    built. It runs immediately before save_file.

    WHAT THIS GUARANTEES, stated at the precision it holds (an earlier revision
    of this docstring claimed a third hazard it did not cover):
      * a DROPPED STAMP is caught -- the stamp map is read here, three lines
        before save_file, and an unresolvable shape without its stamp refuses;
      * a SECOND WRITER PATH is caught -- the check is derived from `out`, and
        `out` is the dict save_file serializes, so any path that builds one is
        gated by construction;
      * a RECLASSIFIED TENSOR is caught on the ROUTED axis -- a routed-expert
        NAME at an unresolvable shape refuses whatever fmt_map says about it,
        because the name test does not consult fmt_map.
    What it does NOT and cannot catch from `out` alone: a name that is not a
    routed expert and not a genuine resident either -- classify()'s "q"
    catch-all. Nothing in the emitted bytes distinguishes such a tensor from an
    audited resident. That axis is closed on the selection side instead, by
    STAMPABLE_KINDS excluding "q", which makes _check_geometry refuse it at these
    same shapes and keeps it out of fmt_map so this gate refuses it too.

    NON-FP8 PASS-THROUGH TENSORS (M1 audit fix, FULL-FAMILY EMISSION): `out` now
    also carries embed_tokens/lm_head/norms/router -- byte-identical BF16/F32
    copies with no `.qs` sidecar and no stamp (see is_passthrough_target). Those
    are not this gate's concern: the collision-shape checks below exist only to
    protect fmt=8's scale-geometry inference on read, which never applies to a
    raw copy. The gate tells the two apart the same way it derives everything
    else here -- from the OUTPUT TENSOR ITSELF, not from a name or a kind the
    selection side computed: every fmt=8 weight this tool emits is written as
    `w.view(torch.uint8)` (see repack_shard), so `t.dtype == torch.uint8` is
    exactly the set this gate must inspect. A raw pass-through tensor keeps its
    original dtype (never uint8), so it is skipped -- structurally, including
    when 1-D (norms), which the 2-D check below would otherwise reject.

    The companion writer-side bound on the stamp map's SIZE is

    Diagnosis (colibri_lab/reports/D1_MINT_DIVERGENCE_2026-08-18.md,
    reproduced locally on this Mac against the installed safetensors build):
    `save_file`'s Rust extension serializes the `metadata=` argument through
    an unordered map -- every VALUE and every tensor payload byte is always
    correct, but the two-key `__metadata__` object's byte order in the

    box: repeat calls in the SAME process differ too, confirmed by minting
    the same fixture twice above this function's own test). CPython dict
    order (the `meta` dict built at the call site) never reaches the
    written bytes, so building `meta` more carefully cannot fix this --
    only touching the bytes after the Rust side has already written them
    can.

    This function does exactly that: read the header back, re-serialize
    `__metadata__` with a canonical (sorted) key order, and write it back
    into the SAME length-prefixed slot. A permutation of the same keys and
    values can only reorder bytes, never add or remove any -- so the
    rewritten header is always <= the original slot (padded with trailing
    spaces to match exactly, the same convention
    tests/test_fp8_e2e_repack_load.py's `_rewrite_metadata` uses, and every
    JSON parser in this tree, including c/json.h's, already skips trailing
    whitespace). No tensor's data_offsets move, so no payload byte is ever

# (and copying it byte-identical from --indir would be actively WRONG here:
# its weight_map keys point at the SOURCE shard names, model-NNNNN-of-00141
# .safetensors, which this tool does not reproduce -- the mint renames/repacks
# into out-fp8pass-*.safetensors, so a copied index would describe a layout
# the minted directory does not have).
#
# The EXTERNAL (non-tensor) files the loader/server actually open from a
# model dir at runtime. Cited by SYMBOL, not line number: the previous table
# carried line anchors that rotted twice, and a stale number is worse than no
# number because it reads as a verification that was not performed.
#   - config.json          colibri.c, cfg_root() -- fopen(...); if(!f){
#     perror(p); exit(1); } -- MANDATORY, the run aborts without it. Also
#     read by openai_server.py's Engine.__init__ for arch detection.
#   - generation_config.json  colibri.c, cfg_root() -- fopen, comment "assente
#     = nessun problema: e' opzionale" -- best-effort; HF's authority for
#     generation defaults (extra EOS stop ids) when present.
#   - tokenizer.json        c/tok.h, tk_read_file() (called from tok_load)
#     -- fopen(...); if(!f){ perror(path); exit(1); } -- MANDATORY. Called
#     from every serve/generate entry point that needs a tokenizer
#     (colibri.c: run_text, run_serve_mux, and the main serve loop).
#     Before this fix main() never copied it into --outdir, so a minted
#     directory was not standalone-loadable for THIS reason alone (confirmed
#     by V2's end-to-end smoke test, 2026-08-18: load only succeeded via a
#     hand-symlinked tokenizer.json borrowed from the sibling source dir).
#
# Files confirmed NOT read anywhere in colibri.c / c/*.h / openai_server.py
# (grepped this worktree; only docstrings/comments reference them, never an
# fopen/Path().open against a model dir) and therefore excluded:
#   - tokenizer_config.json, chat_template.jinja -- the GLM-5.2 chat template
#     is reimplemented natively in code, not read from the .jinja file
#     (colibri.c, comment: "template UFFICIALE GLM-5.2 (chat_template
#     .jinja): niente \n dopo i ruoli..."; openai_server.py: "AUTHORITATIVE
#     GLM-5.2 tool-declaration block (byte-matches chat_template.jinja)" --
#     both hardcoded to match the file's behavior, not sourced from it).
#   - README.md, LICENSE, .gitattributes -- pure repo/documentation metadata,
#     zero references in any loader or server code path.
# Before this fix, main() never copied config.json or generation_config.json
# either, so a minted directory was not standalone-loadable for this reason
