# Test binaries and V4 unit objects. The test globs deliberately have no
# extension: on Unix that is what a built test IS, and matching only
# "tests/test_*.exe" (as this did) meant `make clean` removed nothing at all on
# Linux and macOS.
#
# That is not a tidiness problem -- it silently invalidates verification. Change a
# compile flag, run `make clean && make test-c`, and the stale binaries built
# with the OLD flags are re-run and reported as passing. CONTRIBUTING's
# `make check` starts with exactly that sequence.
#
# KEEP_EXT is the safety rail: a source file must never match. Everything the
# repo tracks under tests/ carries one of these extensions, and directories
# (tests/fixtures/) are skipped by the isfile() check. Object files are not in
# it, so COLI_V4_UNIT_*.o is removed by the same rule rather than a second one.
#
# tests/*_probe* is here for the same reason. The XDNA physical qualification
# probe is built by an explicit `make tests/xdna_physical_probe$(EXE)` and
# matched none of the test_/bench_/fuzz_ prefixes, so it survived every clean.
# A stale probe does not just waste space -- it is the owner that PRODUCES
# physical execution evidence, and a stale one reports PASS for code that is no
# longer in the tree.
#
# *.d are the dependency files -MMD writes beside each binary and object
# (#1741). A stale one only adds prerequisites, but clean should leave nothing
# the build made, and removing it forces the rebuild that writes a fresh one.
# They land wherever an output does: c/ and tests/ for the engines and tests,
# tools/ for the ctypes library; build/segment/ and build/ownership/ go as
# whole directories below.
