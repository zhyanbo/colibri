/* inkling_chain.h -- Inkling's layers as a dense chain on the Vulkan device (vk_chain.h).
 * Included once by inkling.c in a COLI_VULKAN build, after the CPU forward it stands in
 * for; COLI_VK_CHAIN decides (backend_vulkan.c, coli_vk_chain_decide).
 *
 * What runs where, per layer, for one block of rows (decode: one row):
 *   device, frame A1: the MoE output of the layer before joins the residual (the routed
 *     sum from the host, plus each shared expert times its combine weight, in moe()'s
 *     order; then that layer's MLP short convolution and the residual add), the input
 *     RMSNorm, q/k/v and the relative-bias projection r, the short convolutions on K and
 *     V with their rings, the per-head q/k RMSNorms, the attention (chain_relattn.comp:
 *     the bias bank mixed per row and head, tau, the sliding window over a ring cache),
 *     the step's K/V rows into the device ring, o_proj, the attention's short
 *     convolution, the residual add, the post-attention RMSNorm and the router logits
 *     (E routed and the shared experts' logits). Then the frame is waited for.
 *     A dense-MLP layer has no host step: its MLP (gate, up, SwiGLU, down, the global
 *     scale), its short convolution and the residual add follow in the same frame.
 *   host: the sigmoid router with its bias, top-k and the joint combine weights (TOPP
 *     included), the routed experts (the expert tier's device batch and the CPU's share,
 *     joined in rank order: moe_ex, the code moe() runs), the K/V rows copied into the
 *     host's cache.
 *   device, frame A2 (not waited for): the shared experts, while the host computes the
 *     routed experts; their combine weights come up with the routed sum.
 * Crossing per MoE layer: the normalized rows (D floats a row), the router logits
 * (E + n_shared a row) and the K/V rows down; the routed sum (D a row) and the shared
 * experts' weights up. The last frame normalizes the last row, divides it by the logits'
 * width multiplier and runs lm_head; its logits come back. The per-position heads (the
 * logprobs channel, teacher forcing) read the final rows on the host, as before.
 *
 * State and who owns it:
 *   - the residual stream: on the device for the whole forward;
 *   - the K/V cache: the host's stays canonical (every chain step copies its new rows
 *     back). The device holds a mirror per layer with the host's layout, a ring of
 *     `cap` rows on a sliding layer (position t at row t % cap) and the whole context
 *     on a global one. What the host wrote alone (a CPU step) is a range of positions
 *     per layer, [dlo, dhi): the next chain step uploads the rows of its last `cap`
 *     positions first, whatever positions they now hold, so that every row of the
 *     device ring is the host's even after a rewind (a pinned snapshot) over a wrapped
 *     ring. A cache allocated anew (kv_alloc) is mirrored again;
 *   - the four short-convolution states per layer: on the device while the chain runs,
 *     and copied back to the host at the end of every chain step (a few KB a layer), so
 *     the host's are always current; anything that writes the host's (a reset, a pinned
 *     snapshot restored, a CPU step) has the next chain step upload them (or fill zeros).
 *
 * The chain declines (the per-matrix path runs, the state marked as the host's) under
 * CUDA or Metal (they keep their priority), where a matrix is in a form the shaders do
 * not read as this CPU does (bf16 on a CPU whose bf16 dot rounds the activations, as
 * the per-matrix path keeps it on the CPU there), and for a geometry outside its shaders
 * (head dim above 256, a bias bank wider than 64, a convolution above 9 taps).
 * A device lost mid-step: the engine rebuilds the K/V cache and the convolution states
 * on the CPU from the prefix record (the ids the state was built from), a prefill's
 * worth of CPU work, and runs on the CPU from there. Only a state the ids do not
 * describe (audio) cannot be rebuilt: that stops the engine with a message.
 * COLI_VK_CHAIN_FAULT=n (vk_chain.c) fakes the loss at the n-th frame, for tests.
 *
 * Past the device's budget (vk_kvsplit.h) each global layer keeps only a window of
 * blocks of its K/V on the device (the sliding layers' rings are small and stay whole):
 * the step's new rows go into their slots before the attention, which runs over the
 * device's rows (chain_kvs.comp's form of chain_relattn) and on the CPU over the older
 * positions from the host's canonical cache at once, the two merged through their
 * softmax statistics. A split layer's mirror follows a watermark (vkc_kv_lower on a CPU
 * step) instead of the [dlo, dhi) ranges. Below the budget the mirrors are whole.
 *
 * A partial chain (vk_chain.h, vkc_fit; inkc_fit_start at start-up): when the dense
 * layers do not all fit the device, the first n run here and the CPU runs the others and
 * lm_head. Every chunk of a forward crosses the n layers; the residual rows then come down
 * once (the frame that ends the chunk), and the CPU runs layers n.. over all the rows
 * layer by layer, as its own forward does. The device's layers keep their K/V mirrors,
 * rings and convolution states as above; the CPU's layers keep theirs on the host only,
 * so a CPU step lowers and a lost device rebuilds the device's layers alone. A partial
 * chain's matrices (and every layer's, with the host copies dropped) go up at start-up,
 * before the expert cache and the tier size themselves; with every layer fitting and the
 * host copies kept, at the first forward as before. Either way layer by layer: a layer
 * that fails is freed whole and the chain keeps the layers before it. The per-matrix
 * path never uploads a CPU layer's matrices or lm_head. */
