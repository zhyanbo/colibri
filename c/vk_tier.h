/* vk_tier.h -- the Vulkan routed-expert tier shared by the MoE engines.
 *
 * What it does, for a GPU a Vulkan driver can see (COLI_VULKAN=1):
 *   - holds a cache of routed experts in device memory, under a budget taken from
 *     VK_EXT_memory_budget (minus a reserve and the dense trunk the engine will
 *     place there), capped by COLI_VK_TIER_GB;
 *   - fills it at startup from the expert history (.coli_usage, route_trace.h) and
 *     keeps adapting while the user chats: an expert the CPU computes is a candidate,
 *     admitted when there is room or when it is hotter than the coldest resident by
 *     tier.h's LFRU margin, which is then evicted; uploads run on a thread of their
 *     own and never hold up a layer;
 *   - computes, per layer step, every resident expert the routing picked as ONE
 *     asynchronous submit (backend_vulkan.c's expert batch) while the engine computes
 *     the rest on the CPU, then hands back one output row per (row, rank) so the
 *     engine adds them in its own routing order;
 *   - on an integrated GPU, whose device memory is the CPU's RAM, defaults to a
 *     budget that leaves the RAM the engine's expert cache will need;
 *   - accounts device / CPU hits, uploads, evictions and how much device time the
 *     CPU work hid, in one "[VK] tier <engine>" line per run and serve turn;
 *   - with COLI_VK_DEV2=auto|<index>, holds experts on a second device too: the
 *     hottest on the primary device, the next ones on the second (its budget: its free
 *     memory less COLI_VK_RESERVE2_GB, at most COLI_VK_EXPERTS2 experts when set), each
 *     step one batch per device, both in flight at once. Nothing changes for the
 *     engine: the calls below are the same with one device or two;
 *   - keeps the RAM and the VRAM from holding the same experts when RAM is short
 *     (COLI_VK_TIER_EXCLUSIVE, on unless 0): an engine's RAM expert cache that must
 *     evict gives up first a slot whose expert the device holds (vkt_ram_first), and
 *     the prefetchers that read experts into RAM skip what the device holds. With RAM
 *     to spare nothing is evicted and nothing changes.
 * With COLI_VULKAN unset, COLI_VK_TIER=0, a CUDA tier active, or a build without
 * VK=1 (the inline stubs below), nothing here runs and the engine is unchanged.
 *
 * ---- integrating an engine ----------------------------------------------------
 * 0. Open the device saying whether the tier will be tried, so the dense matrices
 *    get their default place (on a device that shares the CPU's RAM they stay on
 *    the CPU while the tier is on; COLI_VK_DENSE decides when set):
 *
 *        ready = coli_vk_init_env_tier("glm53", vkt_wanted() && E > 0 && !cuda_tier);
 *        dense = coli_vk_dense();          // the engine's dense hook checks this
 *        ...                               // step 1
 *        if (ready && !vkt_ready() && !dense)
 *            dense = coli_vk_dense_decide("glm53", 0, 1);   // no tier after all
 *
 * 1. Describe the experts once, after the model and the dense trunk are loaded and
 *    after the engine's history is read (rt_load), before the first token:
 *
 *        VktConfig c = {.engine = "glm53", .layers = L, .experts = E,
 *                       .hidden = H, .inter = F, .topk = K,
 *                       .gate_up = {VKT_SRC_I4U_PAIRS_GS, 64},   // how RAM holds them
 *                       .down    = {VKT_SRC_I4U_PAIRS_GS, 64},
 *                       .act = VKT_ACT_SWIGLU, .act_limit = swiglu_limit,
 *                       .max_rows = prefill_rows * K,
 *                       .ram_reserve = bytes the RAM expert cache may still grow by,
 *                       .dense_bytes = bytes of dense weights the engine will put
 *                                      on the device after this call};
 *        atexit(coli_vk_shutdown);       // runs last: the device goes before the
 *        if (vkt_init(&c, rt_counts_all()))   // drivers unload (a driver can still
 *            atexit(vkt_shutdown);       // be compiling the tier's pipelines), and
 *                                        // whether or not the tier starts: vkt_init
 *                                        // makes the expert batch's pipelines
 *                                        // before it can refuse (no room)
 *
 *    .in_ram (optional) lets the tier hand experts the CPU holds in RAM back to the
 *    CPU when the device is the slower side of a step (an integrated GPU at its
 *    floor clock): give it whenever the engine can answer cheaply.
 *
 *    The heat table is [layers][experts] counts (route_trace.h's rows; NULL rows are
 *    layers without experts). Pick .gate_up/.down from the table below; gate and up
 *    must share one kind. A layer the tier should not serve (an MTP layer in another
 *    format) is simply never passed to vkt_issue: index layers 0..layers-1 only.
 *
 * 2. Warm start (optional, recommended when there is history): the tier plans, the
 *    engine reads each planned expert from disk (any number of threads) and hands
 *    it over, then publishes on the engine thread:
 *
 *        int n = vkt_plan(pl, pe, max);
 *        #pragma omp parallel for
 *        for (i < n) { read expert (pl[i], pe[i]) into a private buffer;
 *                      vkt_put(pl[i], pe[i], &src); }
 *        vkt_put_done();
 *
 * 3. Every MoE layer step, rows x[S][hidden] routed to idx[S][K] (rank order, -1 =
 *    unused slot):
 *
 *        uint8_t taken[S*K];  const float *dev[S*K];
 *        int n = vkt_issue(layer, x, S, K, idx, taken);   // returns at once
 *        for every (s,k) with !taken: compute on the CPU into its own buffer,
 *            and when the expert's bytes are in RAM: vkt_note(layer, e, &src);
 *        shared experts, other CPU work ...
 *        if (n && !vkt_join(dev)) compute the taken (s,k) on the CPU too (device lost);
 *        for s: for k in rank order: out[s] += w[s][k] * (taken ? dev[s*K+k] : cpu[s][k]);
 *
 *    vkt_issue returns how many (s,k) the device took; join only when it took any.
 *
 *    Add in rank order, device or not: then the sum's order never depends on which
 *    experts happened to be resident (it is the CPU run's order, the values differ
 *    by the device's summation order only). Never call the dense Vulkan matmuls
 *    between vkt_issue and vkt_join from a parallel region (backend rule), and
 *    keep one step in flight: join before the next layer's issue.
 *
 * 4. Report: vkt_report("run" or "turn", ram_hits, disk_loads) where the engine
 *    prints its "[VK] <engine>" line; EMAP's tier bits: vkt_resident(l, e) -> 2.
 *
 * 5. Streaming (optional, for prompts; vk_tier.c, "streaming"): give .load and .release
 *    (and .load_batch when the engine reads several experts in parallel), which hand
 *    the tier an expert's bytes as the CPU path would get them. Then
 *      - block a prompt step with B = vkt_step_rows(S, block): the whole step when the
 *        tier streams, so each expert's rows meet in one GEMM;
 *      - vkt_issue takes, besides the resident experts, every cold expert the rule
 *        streams (it loads them through .load, uploads them into its staging slots and
 *        computes them as sub-batches); taken[] says which pairs, as before, and the
 *        join hands back their rows;
 *      - optionally, between submitting the frame that computes a layer's routing and
 *        waiting for it: vkt_stream_prefetch(layer, S) loads the experts that layer will
 *        likely stream while the device works.
 *    COLI_VK_TIER_STREAM=0 turns it off: the tier behaves as without the hooks.
 *
 * Source kinds (VktSrc) and what the device holds -- the conversion runs on the
 * uploader thread, nothing changes in the engine's RAM:
 *   VKT_SRC_I8_ROW        int8, f32 per row                      -> fmt 1
 *   VKT_SRC_I8_GS         int8, f32 per (row, gs)                -> fmt 13

 * Activations (VktConfig.act): VKT_ACT_SWIGLU silu(g)*u, act_limit > 0 clamps the
 * gate from above and up to [-limit, limit] first (GLM-5.3, DeepSeek V4/V4.1);
 * VKT_ACT_SITU a*tanh(g/a)*sigmoid(g) * b*tanh(u/b) with act_a, act_b (Kimi K3);
 * VKT_ACT_SWIGLU_V4 DeepSeek V4's expert with its CPU kernel's roundings: gate and
 * up to bf16, the clamped SwiGLU, times the route weight (vkt_issue_w) and to bf16,
 * then E4M3 and back per 128 inputs before down. The engine hands in x already
 * rounded to E4M3 per 128 (as its kernel rounds it), adds a device row with no
 * weight of its own (the weight is in it) and rounds the row to bf16 first, as
