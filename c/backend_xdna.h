/* Optional AMD XDNA2 (Ryzen AI NPU) compute lane -- host-side binding only.
 *
 * XDNA is an OPTIONAL lane, never an engine. Colibri keeps model semantics,
 * routing, expert identity, weight ownership, scheduling and fallback; the
 * helper only ever executes one already-selected, already-qualified operation.
 *
 * This header and backend_xdna.c are the C-side owners and they NEVER include
 * or link XRT. XRT lives exclusively behind an optional native helper DLL
 * (coli_xdna.dll), resolved at runtime the way backend_loader.c resolves the
 * GPU backend. An ordinary Colibri build has no XRT dependency at all, and a
 * machine with no helper, no XRT and no NPU is a normal machine, not a broken
 * one.
 *
 * Scope of THIS slice (W2-N7-I1): binding only. Nothing here opens a device,
 * reads an artifact, prepares a weight or executes anything -- see the state
 * comment on ColiXdnaBinding.
