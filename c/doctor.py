#: `embed.weight` and `head.weight` (deepseek_v4.c looks up exactly those, at
#: four call sites). Both roles were reported missing for a container the engine
#: loads and generates from, while `model.index`, scanning the same tensors,
#: was green. `_is_final_norm` survived only because `.norm.weight` is a
#: spelling V4 happens to share.
#:
#: Matching on the tail rather than the whole name is what makes this hold for
#: families nobody has written yet: it is prefix-agnostic, which is exactly
#: what the engines already are. `qwen38.c` probes
#: `model.language_model.embed_tokens.weight` and falls back to
