/* kv_prefix.h — reuse the attention state a previous turn already built.
 *
 * A chat client resends the whole transcript every turn. colibri.c has pinned
 * each conversation to a KV slot since #639, so its turn N prefills only the
 * new text; inkling.c, kimi_k3.c and deepseek were written without it and
 * re-processed turns 1..N-1 from scratch. The cost of a message therefore grew
 * with the length of the conversation, and every replayed position pulled its
 * experts off disk again — on a streaming engine that is the dominant cost, not
 * a rounding error. Measured on DeepSeek V4, a second turn that reused 82% of
 * its prompt took 61s instead of 320s.
 *
 * THE IDEA. After a turn, the engine's state covers some number of positions.
 * If the next prompt BEGINS with the token sequence that produced them, that
 * state already IS the state at that position: skip the reset and prefill only
 * the tail. No snapshot, no rewind — a prompt that diverges anywhere starts
 * over.
 *
 * WHY A RECORD AND NOT A COUNTER. It is tempting to derive the reusable length
 * from the caller's own bookkeeping ("prompt_count + generated - 1"). That
 * invariant differs per engine — whether the last sampled token was fed back,
 * whether a chunked prefill ran to completion, whether generation stopped early
 * — and getting it wrong does not crash: it silently answers from a state that
 * belongs to a different conversation. So the ids are recorded WHERE THEY ARE
 * FED, and the record is the only description of the state anyone consults.
 *
 * INVARIANT: fed[0..len-1] are exactly the token ids the current state was
 * built from, in position order. Everything else follows from it.
 *
 * TAINT. Some inputs are not described by their token ids. Inkling's audio
 * frames all carry the same id (c->audio_tok) while the mel payload differs, so
 * an id-only comparison would cheerfully "match" two different clips. A state
 * that consumed such an input is marked tainted and is never reused.
