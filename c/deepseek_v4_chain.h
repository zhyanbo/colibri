/* deepseek_v4_chain.h -- DeepSeek V4's layers as a dense chain on the Vulkan device
 * (vk_chain.h). Included once by deepseek_v4.c's GENERATE_STATS unit in a COLI_VULKAN
 * build, after the per-matrix path (v4_vk_*): the chain's matrices are that path's
 * device copies, looked up in the same map, one copy per matrix. target_batch and
 * target_token hand it their forwards (v4c_forward); COLI_VK_CHAIN decides
 * (coli_vk_chain_decide, this engine's integrated GPU default COLI_VK_CHAIN_UNMEASURED:
 * off, not measured on a V4 checkpoint).
 *
 * The residual is hc_mult streams per position (mHC); each site collapses them with the
 * mix it computes itself (hc_pre). DeepSeek V4 rounds to bf16 after nearly every step
 * and rounds the input of every fp8 matrix to E4M3 per 128 (the CPU kernel's activation):
 * the chain makes each of those roundings where the CPU makes it (vkc_dsv4_round), so
 * the device and the CPU differ only by the order of the sums and the device's exp and
 * sqrt, which the roundings mostly absorb (a value that lands on a bf16 boundary can go
 * the other way, and an E4M3 block then rounds on another step: docs/vulkan.md has what
 * that does to the logits). Every matrix takes the per-row GEMV, so a row's bits do not
 * depend on how a forward is cut into chunks, nor on prompt against decode against a
 * verify, as on the CPU. What runs where, per layer, for one block of rows (decode: one
 * row; a prompt in chunks of the CPU's prefill chunk):
 *   device, frame A1: the previous layer's FFN branch (the routed sum from the host plus
 *     the shared expert, to bf16) written back into the streams (mHC post, bf16); the
 *     attention site: hc_attn_fn, the split with Sinkhorn, the collapse, bf16, the
 *     RMSNorm, bf16; the attention: the input to E4M3, wq_a, bf16, q_norm, bf16; on a
 *     compressed layer the compressor (wkv and wgate in bf16 on the f32 input, the ring
 *     with its position bias, the pooled rows to bf16, their norm, bf16, RoPE at the
 *     group's first position, the no-position part to E4M3 per 64); on a ratio-4 layer
 *     the indexer (its own compressor into the keys: norm, RoPE, the Hadamard transform,
 *     E2M1 per 32; the queries: indexer wq_b on the q latent, bf16, RoPE, Hadamard,
 *     E2M1; weights_proj; the relu-weighted scores and the top-k in score order); wq_b,
 *     bf16, the per-head RMS without weight, bf16; wkv, bf16, kv_norm, bf16; RoPE (YaRN's
 *     table on compressed layers) with bf16 on the rotated part; the key's no-position
 *     part to E4M3 per 64, bf16; the new rows into the window ring; the sparse attention
 *     with the sink over the window and the compressed rows (V4's bf16 weights and
 *     output), the inverse RoPE, bf16; wo_a per group (each group's input to E4M3),
 *     bf16, wo_b, bf16; mHC post, bf16; the FFN site's split, collapse, norm. Then the
 *     frame is waited for.
 *   host: the routed experts (coli_v4_moe_routed: the bf16 or the hash router, the
 *     expert tier's batch and the CPU's share, summed in the CPU block's order).
 *   device, frame A2 (not waited for): the shared expert (the input to E4M3, w1 and w3,
 *     V4's SwiGLU between bf16 roundings, the input to E4M3, w2, bf16).
 * The final streams come back to the host, which runs final_hidden and the head as
 * before; DSpark's taps of the last three layers' streams too (v4_mainh_tap).
 *
 * State, and who owns it: the host's stays canonical. What a forward changes there (the
 * window ring, the compressed rows and their count, each compressor's ring, the
 * indexer's keys and count and its compressor's ring) is written back once the
 * forward's last frame is through, as the CPU would have left it, so a lost device, a
 * rejected draft (spec_attention_restore), a prefix checkpoint, a reset or a CPU forward
 * never has to rebuild anything. The device mirrors it: the window ring holds window +
 * chunk rows (no row of a chunk overwrites one an earlier row still reads) behind a
 * watermark win_valid, a row below it valid unless a later position took its slot (a
 * rejected draft longer than a chunk does: slot_pos says); the compressed rows and the
 * indexer's keys of each layer behind kv_valid / ik_valid; each ring behind a flag.
 * Every host write lowers them: a CPU
 * forward (v4c_cpu_step), a restored snapshot (v4c_restored), a reset or a checkpoint
 * restore (v4c_reset), a forward that does not continue where the chain left off, an
 * attention state the mirrors do not describe. A lost device (COLI_VK_CHAIN_FAULT=n
 * fakes it): the forward runs again on the CPU from its input, which the chain leaves
 * untouched until every chunk is through, and the CPU runs from there.
 *
 * Past the device's budget (vk_kvsplit.h) each compressed layer keeps only some blocks of
 * its compressed rows on the device: a window over the newest rows and the blocks its
 * list reads most; the rest stay in the host's compressed rows, which hold every row. The
 * sparse attention stages only selected missing rows in bounded device scratch and
 * reads them alongside resident rows in the original list order (vkc_kv_ds). This
 * preserves one global score maximum and V4's bf16 weights and output exactly. A
 * chunk's new compressed rows go through a scratch into their slots and come back into
 * the host's rows (reserved for the forward at its start) as soon as their layer's frame
 * is through, so the host part of a later chunk finds every row it reads; the count is
 * set at the end as before. The window ring and the indexer's keys stay whole on the
 * device. Below the budget the mirrors are whole, as above.
 *
 * The chain declines (the CPU runs, the watermarks follow) when the dense layers are not
 * resident (a low-memory plan reloads them per forward; the --oracle path's own copies
 * too), under the CUDA tier, for prompts only when COLI_VK_CHAIN=2 and the forward has
 * two rows or fewer, for a forward whose compressed rows (window plus every row of a
 * layer without an indexer) pass the attention's 3072 entries, and for a model its
 * shaders do not take: head_dim above 1024, an indexer head that is not a power of two
 * (the Hadamard transform) or above 4096 floats, a top-k above 4096, more than 8
 * streams.
 *
 * Layers on two devices (docs/vulkan.md, "Layers on two devices"): with COLI_VK_DEV2 a
 * second chain takes the layers after the primary's on that device (its own fit from
 * layer N, COLI_VK_CHAIN_LAYERS2; its own copies of their matrices, in a table of their
 * own: the per-matrix path's map stays the primary's); the head stays on the host. A
 * layer reads only its own state, so only the streams cross: a forward runs the
 * primary's layers, then the second device's from the streams it hands over. A second
 * device that is lost, or declines a forward, leaves the CPU to run its layers from
 * there (the host's state is current: nothing to rebuild); lost, both chains go off. */
