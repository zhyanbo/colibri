The pinned DeepSeek-V4 reference runner in `c/tools/dsv4_vllm_reference.py`
executes an unmodified vLLM checkout (commit
`ffd46bfab2128bb84146050e98b51a617c6575ab`) as a behavioural oracle for the
native port; no vLLM code is vendored.

## Swiftlet qpack and MLX affine Metal GEMV

`c/qpack.c` and `c/qpack.h` implement the Swiftlet qpack v1 container schema
documented by `Sources/SwiftletCore/Qpack.swift` at the commit linked below.
The reader is a new portable implementation for Colibri and does not copy
Swift source code.

The MLX affine Q4/Q8 kernels in `c/backend_metal.mm` are adapted from
`gemv_affine_fast` and `gemv_affine_fast8` in Swiftlet:
https://github.com/leonickson1/Swiftlet at commit
`b3a04676748c7597800c5bcc8b80a32508f9f43d`.

Swiftlet is licensed under Apache License 2.0. The kernels were modified for
Colibri's checked descriptor, batched dispatch, buffer ownership, and fallback
contract. This repository's `LICENSE` contains the applicable Apache 2.0 text.

## DeepGEMM sm120 headers (fetched, not vendored: `c/third_party/deepgemm/`)

The DeepSeek V4 CUDA tier's DeepGEMM flavour (`make cuda-dsv4-dg-dll`,
`Makefile.deepseek-v4 DEEPGEMM=1`) compiles against headers that
`c/tools/fetch_deepgemm.sh` checks out at a pinned commit into the gitignored
`c/third_party/deepgemm/`; nothing from them is committed to this repository.
What that checkout contains, and the licences that apply when you build with it:

- DeepGEMM (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 DeepSeek), from the community sm120 port
  https://github.com/bvolpato/DeepGEMM branch `sm120-full` @
  39fb4447a062b418fd08ce17cd308adb28559417, with
  `c/patches-deepgemm-sm120-msvc.patch` applied at fetch time. License text:
  `c/third_party/deepgemm/LICENSE` after the fetch.
- NVIDIA CUTLASS / CuTe (BSD-3-Clause), the `third-party/cutlass` submodule of
  that commit @ f3fde58372d33e9a5650ba7b80fc48b3b49d40c8. License text:
  `c/third_party/deepgemm/third-party/cutlass/LICENSE.txt` after the fetch.

## Swiftlet qpack installers (`c/tools/qpack_*install*.py`)

Swiftlet (https://github.com/leonickson1/Swiftlet) is licensed under Apache
License 2.0. This repository's `LICENSE` contains the applicable Apache 2.0
text.

`c/tools/qpack_install_policy.py` adapts the source-bound resume and
manifest-last completion policy from Swiftlet's `StreamingInstaller.swift` at
commit `86246618ba2af30334227e09ff84a6a7182c2a40`. It is a new
transport-neutral Python implementation and does not copy Swift source code.

`c/tools/qpack_http_install.py` is a new Python HTTP frontend over that policy.
It interoperates with Hugging Face-hosted Swiftlet qpack repositories but does
not copy Swiftlet or huggingface_hub source code.

`c/tools/qpack_mirror_install.py` and the static-mirror support in
`c/tools/qpack_http_install.py` interoperate with the `hashes.json` schema
emitted by Swiftlet's `scripts/verify_container.py`. They are new Python
implementations with stricter path, transport, credential, resume, and digest
validation; no Swiftlet source code is copied.
