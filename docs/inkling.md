# Inkling (Thinking Machines 975B MoE) on colibri

`c/inkling.c` runs [Thinking Machines Inkling](https://huggingface.co/thinkingmachines/Inkling)
(975B total / 41B active, Apache 2.0) with colibri's expert-streaming approach:
dense weights resident (RAM or VRAM), routed experts streamed from disk with an
LRU + pinned cache. Audio input is supported when the audio tensors are present
(see [Audio input](#audio-input-dmel) below); the vision encoder and the MTP
head are not loaded.

## Quickstart

Pre-converted weights (int4 experts + bf16 residents, 514 GB as Hugging Face lists the repository):

```sh
hf download nbeerbower/Inkling-colibri-int4 --local-dir ~/Models/inkling_i4
```

or convert the original bf16 checkpoint yourself (shard-resumable; `--watch`
converts while the download is still running):

```sh
python3 c/tools/convert_inkling_int4.py --indir <bf16-checkpoint> --outdir ~/Models/inkling_i4
```

Build and run:

```sh
make -C c inkling                # pure CPU (dependency-free, like glm)
make -C c inkling CUDA=1         # + bf16 residents in VRAM (needs ~37 GB free)

SNAP=~/Models/inkling_i4 ./c/inkling -p "The capital of France is" -n 64
```

Requirements: ~120 GB RAM (CPU build keeps ~86 GB of bf16 residents in RAM;
the CUDA build moves them to VRAM and uses the freed RAM for a larger expert
cache), NVMe storage for the snapshot.

## If you have less RAM than that

The pre-converted container has **int4 routed experts but bf16 dense weights**, and
the dense set is resident: every token needs all of it. Measured on the real
snapshot it is **49.4 GB**, and `load_w` expands bf16 to f32 while loading, so the
peak is ~99 GB. Below roughly 64 GB of RAM the process dies before it generates
anything.

Quantizing just the dense set to **int4-gs64** brings it to **15.3 GB**, which fits a
25 GB box. One pass over the shards, originals untouched, ~14 minutes:

```sh
python3 c/tools/convert_inkling_dense_int4.py --dir ~/Models/inkling_i4 --plan   # estimate first
python3 c/tools/convert_inkling_dense_int4.py --dir ~/Models/inkling_i4

mkdir -p ~/Models/inkling_i4/dense-int4g64
mv ~/Models/inkling_i4/dense-int4g64.safetensors \
   ~/Models/inkling_i4/dense-int4g64/dense.safetensors
```

The engine picks the container up automatically (it prints `[dense] container
int4-gs64: …`); `INK_DENSE_Q4=0` ignores it and goes back to bf16. **With enough RAM
you do not need any of this** — leave the container out and nothing changes.

Quantization error, measured against the real bf16 weights:

| Tensors | Format | Rel. L2 error |
|---|---|---|
| attention, shared experts, dense MLP | int4-gs64 | ~11% |
| `embed_tokens`, `lm_head` | int8 per-row | ~0.9% |
| norms, biases, router, conv1d | untouched | 0 |

11% is what 4 bits costs on this weight distribution (quantization noise ≈ 0.135σ for
16 levels over ±amax in groups of 64) — not a defect of the conversion. It is enough
for coherent output: the 975B answers correctly on a 25 GB host. `embed`/`lm_head` are
kept at int8 because they enter *every* token. `ATTN_BITS=8` moves attention to int8
too (error 11% → 1.1%, +4 GB) if you would rather spend the RAM.

**Speed, honestly:** with only ~8 GB left for the expert cache after the dense set,
residency is ~1.7% of the 464 GB expert bank, so decode is disk-bound — tens of
seconds per token on a single NVMe, not interactive. This path is what makes the model
*runnable and testable* on a small host, not fast. Pinning (`PIN`) and a larger cache
help in proportion to the RAM you can give them.

## Modes

| Invocation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-p "text" [-n N]` | streaming greedy generation (stops at eos or N tokens) |
| `--chat -p "text"` | wraps the prompt in Inkling's chat template (role tokens + `<\|content_text\|>`, `<\|message_model\|>` as the generation prompt). Instruct models fed raw text are out of distribution and answer badly. `THINK=<0..1>` raises the reasoning effort (default 0) |
| `-f prompts.txt [-n N]` | one prompt per line (`#` comments skipped), single model load, state reset between prompts — the cache-warming workflow below |
| `--audio file.dmel [-p "text"]` | spoken input: raw u8 DMel frames `[n_frames, 80]`, one `<\|audio\|>` position per frame (implies `--chat`) |
| `[cap] [bits] [ref.json]` | token-exact oracle harness against a `tools/make_tiny_inkling.py` fixture (CI-style validation; `tools/make_tiny_inkling_audio.py` for the audio path) |

`coli chat` / `coli serve` / `coli web` render the same template through the
gateway, so there is nothing to pass there.

## Audio input (DMel)

Inkling hears through discretized log-mel frames ("DMel"): 80 mel bands per
50 ms of audio, each quantized to 16 levels. Its audio "tower" is one
embedding table plus one norm — a frame's embedding is the RMSNorm of a sum
of 80 table rows, swapped in at that frame's `<|audio|>` position. No
Whisper-style encoder, no extra runtime: with the two audio tensors present
the engine takes spoken input at full precision, and without them it is the
same text-only engine as before.

Two ways to get the tensors:

- **Converting yourself:** add `--keep-audio` to `convert_inkling_int4.py`.
  It passes `model.audio.*` through (~10 MB bf16 on Inkling-Small).
- **Already have a text-only container?** The two tensors can be pulled out
  of the original checkpoint's shards with HTTP range requests — ~10 MB
  moved instead of re-downloading the full bf16 checkpoint — and written as
  an `audio.safetensors` sidecar next to the snapshot. The engine indexes
  every `*.safetensors` in the directory, so it just gets picked up:

```python
import json, struct, urllib.request

REPO = "https://huggingface.co/thinkingmachines/Inkling-Small/resolve/main"
NAMES = ["model.audio.encoder.weight", "model.audio.final_norm.weight"]

def rng(url, a, b):
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={"Range": f"bytes={a}-{b}"})
    return urllib.request.urlopen(req).read()

index = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(f"{REPO}/model.safetensors.index.json").read())
header, blobs, off = {}, [], 0
for name in NAMES:
    url = f"{REPO}/{index['weight_map'][name]}"
    n = struct.unpack("<Q", rng(url, 0, 7))[0]
    info = json.loads(rng(url, 8, 7 + n))[name]
    a, b = info["data_offsets"]
    raw = rng(url, 8 + n + a, 8 + n + b - 1)
    header[name] = {"dtype": info["dtype"], "shape": info["shape"],
                    "data_offsets": [off, off + len(raw)]}
    blobs.append(raw)
    off += len(raw)
hdr = json.dumps(header).encode()
with open("audio.safetensors", "wb") as f:
    f.write(struct.pack("<Q", len(hdr)) + hdr + b"".join(blobs))
```

Input format: mono 16 kHz. Through the gateway, send a WAV (PCM16 or
float32) as an OpenAI `input_audio` content part — the gateway computes the
DMel frames itself (numpy needed for that path only). Through the CLI, pass
pre-encoded frames as raw bytes with `--audio`. Note that audio inflates the
prompt: ~5 s of speech is ~100 positions, so prefill speed counts double for
spoken turns.

```sh
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -d '{
  "model": "inkling-colibri",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
    {"type": "input_audio", "input_audio": {"data": "<base64 wav>", "format": "wav"}}
  ]}]
}'
```

## Expert cache size

`cap` (first positional argument, or `--cap` through `coli`) is how many experts each
layer keeps in RAM. Each slot is ~28 MB on the 975B, so `cap × n_layers × 28 MB` has to
fit next to the resident dense set — with the int4 dense container on a 25 GB host that
means `cap` around 2.

Small values are **correct** but slow: the engine processes the routed experts in rounds
of `cap` and accumulates, so an expert evicted mid-token is re-read rather than silently
replaced by the wrong one. (It used to be silently replaced: acquiring all `S×topk`
slots up front meant a full cache evicted slots that were already handed out for the
current token, and the model computed with whatever landed in them. A prefill of 18
tokens at `topk=6` needs up to 108 distinct experts per layer, so anything below that
produced incoherent output with no error message.)

## Cache warming (same idea as glm's `.coli_usage`)

Expert selections are counted per `(layer, expert)` and written to
`SNAP/.coli_usage` after each generation run. On startup the top `PIN_N`
experts per layer are pinned (non-evictable, loaded in one parallel burst).
Counts **accumulate across runs**, so the ranking converges toward your real
workload — pins trained on a single prompt overfit badly (see the benchmark
table), which is why a diverse warmup matters:

```sh
SNAP=~/Models/inkling_i4 ./c/inkling -f warmup_prompts.txt -n 32
```

| Env | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PIN=off` | disable warming entirely: no seeding, no pins, no history rewrite |
| `PIN=<path>` | alternate history file |
| `PIN_N=<n>` | pins per layer (default `cap/2`; 0 = seed ranking only) |
| `USAGE_SAVE=0` | don't rewrite the history (benchmark runs) |
| `NOGPU=1` / `GPU_DEV=<n>` | disable CUDA / select device |
| `IDOT=0` | byte-exact scalar int kernels (debugging) |
| `INK_SHARED_BATCH=0` | disable shared-expert prefill batching for a controlled A/B; positive values cap rows per chunk. The default uses up to 64 MiB of bounded scratch and never changes decode (`S=1`) |
| `TOPP=<p>` | adaptive routing: keep routed experts up to cumulative weight `p`, drop the tail. **Trims the routing** — fewer experts read per token (the lever that matters on a disk-bound host), but a different computation from the declared top-k. Off by default; the run reports `[topp] … N/M routed used (X% trimmed)` so the trade is measurable. Same semantics as `TOPP` in `colibri.c` and `K3_TOPP` in `kimi_k3.c` |
| First positional arg | expert-cache cap per layer (`0` = auto-size from free RAM) |

## Vulkan: the routed experts on the GPU

`make -C c inkling VK=1`, then `COLI_VULKAN=1`: the routed experts go to the shared
Vulkan expert tier ([vulkan.md](vulkan.md#inkling-and-olmoe)), a cache of experts on
the device that fills at startup from the history the cache warming above keeps
(`SNAP/.coli_usage`, or `PIN=<path>`; the `ref.json` oracle reads none) and adapts
while you chat. Every MoE layer sends the resident experts' (token, rank) pairs to the
device as one batch while the CPU computes the rest and the shared experts, then adds
every rank in routing order, so the sum's order does not depend on what was resident.

- The experts go over as the cache holds them, nothing requantized: the int4
  container (packed nibbles, one scale per row), the int8 container, the runtime
  quantization (`bits` 2 to 8) and f32 (`bits=0`). The fused `gate_up` tensor is
  read as two matrices, gate from row 0 and up from row I.
- The dense matrices (attention, dense MLP, shared experts, lm_head) go to the
  device in their RAM form, the `dense-int4g64/` container's int8 and int4-g64
  included, except on a GPU that shares the CPU's RAM while the tier is on: there
  they stay on the CPU unless `COLI_VK_DENSE=1`.
- With the CUDA backend (`CUDA=1` and a device) or Metal on, the Vulkan tier stays
  off: the other backend wins.
- One line per run and serve turn, `[VK] tier inkling run: device N of M routed
  experts ...`; the dashboard's expert map shows a device-resident expert as tier 2.
  The knobs are `COLI_VK_TIER*` in [ENVIRONMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT.md#vulkan-any-gpu-with-a-vulkan-12-driver).

Status: correct, not yet measured for speed. CI checks the tiny fixture on Lavapipe in
every expert format above, under eviction, with a warm start and through serve, and
again under ASan and UBSan; the 975B has not run on it.

## Performance (975B, Ryzen 9 7900 / 24t, 187 GB DDR5, RTX A6000, NVMe)

24-token greedy decode, 5-token prompt, commit-tagged runs, single run each.
"Trained" = usage history built from the same prompt; "novel" = never-seen prompt.

| Configuration | Prefill | Decode | Cache hit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stage A (plain LRU, serial I/O, CPU) | 150.2 s | 0.06 tok/s | ~0% |
| + packed-int4 cache, parallel fills, pins (CPU) | 21.1 s | 0.25 tok/s | 81.5% |
| + CUDA resident tier (A6000) | 18.4 s | 0.32 tok/s | 83.6% |
| + deep pins, trained prompt (`PIN_N=64`) | 1.9 s | 2.51 tok/s | 100.0% |
| deep pins, novel prompt (overfit pins) | 33.8 s | 0.17 tok/s | 79.8% |
| **steady state: 11-prompt diverse history, default pins, novel prompt** ¹ | **35.4 s** | **0.25 tok/s** | **82.2%** |

¹ 48-token generation, 13-token prompt. With only a small warmup corpus the
ranking is barely ahead of plain LRU; hit rate (and therefore decode speed)
grows toward the trained-prompt number as real-use history accumulates.

Phase profile at high hit rates: ~90% CPU expert matmul — the next lever is
expert compute on the GPU, not more I/O work.

## Validation

Every mode is token-exact against HF transformers on a tiny random-init oracle
(`c/tools/make_tiny_inkling.py`): f32, int4-container (VNNI and `IDOT=0`
scalar), bf16 residents on CPU, and bf16 residents through the CUDA kernel.
The tokenizer (o200k family, auto-detected by `tok.h`) encodes 357/357 test
strings identically to HF `tokenizers`. The converter round-trips a fabricated
TML-layout checkpoint back through the engine exactly (`--selftest-e2e`).
