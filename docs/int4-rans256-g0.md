# `int4-rans256-g0` — lossless entropy-coded container tier for per-row int4 experts

Status: format specification + offline tools, PR 1 of a 3-PR ladder. This PR
adds the codec (`c/rans.h`), the repack/verify tools
(`c/tools/repack_rans.py`, `c/tools/rans_verify.py`) and this document —
**no engine code paths change**. PR 2 (loader + CPU decode on expert load)
and PR 3 (Metal batched decode) build on it. The format's identity is the
NAME string `int4-rans256-g0`; its registry row has since landed in
FORMATS.md with ordinal *(none)* — no numeric `fmt` ordinal exists or is
claimed before engine code consuming the format (PR 2) first merges into
dev (see "Registry row (landed)" below).

## What it is, in one paragraph

`int4-rans256-g0` losslessly entropy-codes the packed int4 weight bytes of
routed-expert projections (`gate_proj`/`up_proj`/`down_proj`) with a
**single static rANS table shared per shard**, laid out as **256 independent
round-robin-interleaved streams per tensor** so wide decoders (SIMD lanes,
GPU threadgroups) get coalesced output. On a full-corpus census of a per-row
int4 GLM-5.2 container the achieved ratio is ~0.76 (≈24% fewer bytes to
store and stream), with byte-exact reconstruction — this is a codec, not a
quantizer: decode reproduces the original packed bytes exactly, always.

Name breakdown: `int4` — source alphabet is 4-bit quantization codes
(nominally 16, effectively 15 symbols: the symmetric quantizer never emits
the -8 code point, and the table handles that automatically via a zero
frequency); `rans256` — rANS entropy coding, 256-way interleave; `g0` —
shared static table, generation 0.

## Container shape

Output is **ordinary safetensors shards**. Each entropy-coded weight tensor
keeps its **original, unmodified logical name** (so any name-indexed loader
finds it with zero special-casing), stored as dtype `U8`, shape
`[record_len]` — an opaque byte blob whose contents are the chunk record
below. The `.qs` per-row scale sidecars are **unchanged raw F32** (they are
~0.1% of the byte stream on per-row geometry; coding them is not worth a
second codec path in v1).

### Chunk record (one record = one weight tensor's bytes)

All integers little-endian — explicitly including the `n_symbols` and
`packed_bytes` u64 fields and every `stream_offsets` u32 (the same
byte order the base64 `slot_to_symbol` field spells out). `N` = 256
streams. The reference C implementation reads/writes these with
native-order accesses and therefore refuses to compile on a big-endian
host rather than emit byte-swapped records.

```
offset 0:  n_symbols     u64   -- nibble count for this tensor
offset 8:  packed_bytes  u64   -- original packed-byte count (= ceil(n_symbols/2)),
                                  stored so a reader can size its output buffer
offset 16: stream_offsets[N+1]  u32 x (N+1)
                                -- offsets[i] = byte offset, relative to the start
                                   of `payload`, where stream i begins;
                                   offsets[N] = total payload length
then:      zero-pad to the next 16-byte boundary (derived, never stored)
payload:   N independent rANS byte streams, concatenated in stream order:
           stream i is payload[offsets[i] : offsets[i+1]]
then:      zero-pad to the next 16-byte boundary (derived, never stored)
```

The two padding runs are computed identically by writer and reader
(`round16()`), never stored — a stored length could disagree with the
derived value. Validators refuse nonzero padding bytes. Alignment is
**record-relative**, not file-absolute: safetensors does not 16-align
tensor offsets, so a consumer that wants aligned u32/u64 access must read or
map the tensor's bytes into an aligned allocation (any `malloc`/GPU-buffer
allocation qualifies; the reference parser refuses a buffer that is not at
least 4-byte aligned rather than perform unaligned accesses).

Validity rules every conformant record satisfies (and validators enforce):

- `packed_bytes == ceil(n_symbols / 2)`, computed in a non-wrapping form
  (`n/2 + (n & 1)`) so `n_symbols = 2^64 - 1` cannot forge a match;
- `stream_offsets[0] == 0`, offsets non-decreasing, and **every stream is at
  least 4 bytes** — even a stream that encodes zero symbols carries its
  4 flushed state bytes;
- the record's total length equals the derived framing exactly (no trailing
  bytes), and every derived padding byte is zero. That length is the
  **physical extent**, known from stored framing before decode — not the
  identity inference the stamp section forbids (`expected_bytes(O, I)`);
- **amplification bound**: no admissible table can encode more than
  `payload_len * 8 * M_max` symbols into a payload (`M_max = 2^15`, the
  format's largest table size — a symbol's cost is bounded below by
  `log2(M / (M-1))` bits). A header claiming more `n_symbols` than that is
  a decompression bomb and must be refused *before* anything sizes buffers
  from it.

### Interleaving

Nibbles are unpacked low-nibble-first (`nib[2k] = byte[k] & 0xF`,
`nib[2k+1] = byte[k] >> 4`). Nibble at logical index `j` belongs to stream
`j % N` and is the `(j / N)`-th symbol of that stream. Every stream is an
ordinary, self-contained, single-state rANS stream over the same shared
table — no cross-stream coupling. Round-robin (not block) assignment is the
property that makes wide decode output-coalesced: lane `l` of a group based
at stream `b` emits logical position `r*N + b + l` at round `r`, so a
G-lane group writes G contiguous nibbles = G/2 whole packed bytes.

### Per-stream codec

ryg_rans-style construction (Fabian Giesen's public-domain reference
design): 32-bit state, byte renormalization, `L = 2^23`,
`scale_bits = 14` (`M = 16384`).

- encode walks the input backwards, writes bytes backwards, flushes the
  final 4-byte state. Per symbol `s` (this is the complete recipe a
  bit-identical third-party **writer** needs): with the state
  `x` (initialized to `L`), first renormalize by emitting low bytes —
  `x_max = ((L >> scale_bits) << 8) * freq[s]`;
  `while (x >= x_max) { emit byte x & 0xFF; x >>= 8; }` — then update
  `x = ((x / freq[s]) << scale_bits) + (x % freq[s]) + start[s]`
  (integer division). After the last (i.e. first-in-stream-order) symbol,
  emit the remaining 32-bit state as 4 bytes, low byte last. The emitted
  byte sequence, reversed into forward order, is the stream. Worst case a
  `freq = 1` symbol emits `scale_bits` bits, so a stream of `n` symbols
  never exceeds `ceil(n * scale_bits / 8) + 4` bytes;
- decode reads forward:
  `x = 4 bytes big-endian`, then per symbol:
  `slot = x & (M-1)`; `s = slot_to_symbol[slot]`;
  `x = freq[s]*(x >> scale_bits) + slot - start[s]`;
  `while (x < L) { if bytes remain: x = (x<<8)|next byte; else break; }`.
- The `else break` is load-bearing: a stream's final symbols legally decode
  with `x < L`; a decoder that reads past the stream end produces wrong
  tail symbols.
- Verifiable invariants of any genuine encoder output (validators use them
  to refuse corruption **without ground-truth bytes**): the initial 4-byte
  state lies in `[L, 256L)`; decode consumes the stream exactly; the final
  state is exactly `L`.

### Shared table, in shard metadata

The table ships **once per shard** in
`__metadata__["colibri.int4-rans256-g0.table"]`, a JSON string:

```json
{
  "table_id": "g0",
  "n_streams": 256,
  "scale_bits": 14,
  "M": 16384,
  "freq": [16 uint32, summing to M],
  "start": [16 uint32, the exclusive prefix sum of freq],
  "slot_to_symbol_b64": "<base64 of M x uint16, little-endian>",
  "table_crc32": "<hex crc32 of the raw slot_to_symbol bytes>"
}
```

Decode is always shard-local: every record in a shard decodes against that
shard's embedded copy, no cross-shard or external-file dependency. A
multi-shard writer must stamp the byte-identical table into every shard it
emits (the repack tool builds the table once, from the pooled histogram of
every selected tensor, and reuses the same JSON string). `table_crc32`
lets tooling confirm two shards used the identical table without diffing
the base64 blob. `table_id` is provenance metadata (a retuned future table
would ship as `g1`); readers never resolve it externally.

## THE STAMP IS MANDATORY (the load-bearing difference from fmt=8)

`__metadata__["colibri.fmt"]` maps each entropy-coded **weight** tensor
name (never `.qs`) to the string `int4-rans256-g0`, JSON-encoded with
sorted keys.

For the existing formats the engine can infer identity from byte arithmetic
(`weight bytes == formula(O, I)`), and a stamp is at most a cross-check.
**That inference is structurally impossible here**: entropy-coded size is
data-dependent — there is no `expected_bytes(O, I)` to compare against. The
stamp is therefore the **only** signal that a `U8` tensor is entropy-coded
at all. Data-dependence applies to **identity inference**, not to **extent**:
the record's physical length is fully determined by the stored framing before
decode (header, stream offsets, payload, the two `round16()` pads; see the
validity rules above, "the record's total length equals the derived framing
exactly"), so page-aligned I/O (4 KiB-padded extents, `O_DIRECT`) remains
available. The stamp is still mandatory because identity, not size, is what
cannot be inferred. Consequences any consumer must respect:

- an *unstamped* `U8` tensor must never be presumed entropy-coded by any
  size heuristic;
- a future engine read path needs a stamp-gated dispatch **ahead of** the
  byte-arithmetic format inference: stamped `int4-rans256-g0` → rANS decode
  path; anything else → today's inference, completely unchanged. Getting
  that order wrong would misread a compressed blob as a fixed-ratio format
  and corrupt every weight with no error;
- validators refuse a shard whose stamps and table are not both present and
  coherent (`tools/rans_verify.py` is the reference validator, with a named
  refusal per corruption class).

## Scope (v1)

Per-row ("gs=0") int4 expert containers only. Per-group (g64-class)
containers are out of scope: their better-normalized codes measure a much
weaker ratio (~0.89 vs ~0.76) and their scale arrays are a two-orders-larger
share of the stream — a g64 round would need scale coding to be worth
doing, which is its own design. The repack tool *refuses* (by name) a
tensor whose weight-bytes/scale-rows ratio is the g64 signature rather than
silently coding it under this format's identity.

## Reference implementation map

- `c/rans.h` — dependency-free C99, header-only: scalar codec, record
  writer/reader with named refusals, batched decode arms (scalar, branch-free
  scalar, NEON, AVX-512 F+BW). Vector arms are byte-identical to scalar by
  contract and carry a compile-time ISA gate, a first-use round-trip
  selftest (a failing arm disables itself loudly) and env kill-switches
  (`RANS_NEON=0`, `RANS_AVX512=0`; `RANS_PATH=<arm>` forces one and refuses
  if unavailable — never a silent downgrade).
- `make rans` — builds `tools/librans_c.*`, the ctypes bridge the Python
  tools prefer; without it they fall back to a pure-Python codec that emits
  identical bytes, slowly.
- `c/tools/repack_rans.py` — writer. Deterministic: same input ⇒
  byte-identical shards. Verifies every record byte-exact before writing.
- `c/tools/rans_verify.py` — validator (TRUST-VERIFY-REFUSE; the doc of
  refusal classes is its module docstring).
- `c/tests/test_rans.c`, `c/tests/test_rans_repack.py` — property suite,
  arm-identity sweep, framing/refusal battery, e2e round trip.

A third-party consumer needs only this document plus the scalar decode
description above to read records: parse the shard header, find the stamp
and table in `__metadata__`, locate a tensor's record by name, and decode
its 256 streams with the table (in any order or in parallel).

## Whole-artifact verification

Per-record validation (framing, stream invariants, re-encode pin) proves a
record is *a* well-formed artifact of this format — it cannot prove it is
*the* record a given mint run produced: a well-formed record swapped in
from another checkpoint passes every check above. For that, the writer's
`repack-manifest.json` (the completion marker, written last, deterministic)
carries per shard a whole-file `sha256` (the complete `.safetensors` bytes,
hashed while streaming the write — it subsumes the `.qs` sidecars, the
header, and the padding, none of which per-record digests can see) plus a
`records` map — original tensor name → sha256 of the emitted record bytes
exactly as written — for granular diagnosis. `rans_verify.py` checks the
file hash first, then every record against its digest, whenever the
manifest sits next to the shards (named refusals:
`E_SHARD_DIGEST_MISMATCH`, `E_DIGEST_MISMATCH`, `E_DIGEST_MISSING`,
`E_MANIFEST_MALFORMED`); a manifest without digests, or no manifest, means
no check is possible (a note, never an error), and
`repack_rans.py --manifest-only <dir>` retro-generates digests for
already-minted directories by hashing shards in place. This is **build
integrity** — these exact bytes came from that mint run; container
*identity* proper remains the stamp/registry lineage above, and the
engine-side load check ships with the consumer PR. The record wire format
is untouched by all of this: the manifest is a sidecar file.

## Registry row (landed)

The registry row this section originally *proposed* now exists in
`docs/FORMATS.md` (the authoritative copy — this table is a summary):

| ordinal | name | weight bytes | scale layout | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `int4-rans256-g0` | data-dependent (chunk record above; **stamp mandatory**) | per-row `F32` `.qs`, raw (unchanged from int4-row) | merged, offline tools only |

The ordinal cell reads *(none)*, not *(maintainer-assigned)*: with no
engine decode path there is nothing to compile an ordinal into, so — as
the FORMATS.md row glosses the registry's ID-assignment rule — no public
ordinal is claimed before engine code consuming the format (this ladder's
PR 2) first merges into dev.
