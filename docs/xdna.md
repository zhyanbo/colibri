# XDNA backend (Windows, AMD Ryzen AI NPU)

colibrì includes an **experimental, opt-in** backend that runs some GLM
operations on an AMD XDNA2 NPU using a **reduced-precision BF16 compute path**.
It is off by default, it is never selected automatically, and model output may
differ from the normal path.

```bash
coli run --xdna "your prompt"
```

Without `--xdna` nothing changes: no helper is loaded, no device is opened, and
the engine produces exactly the results it produces today. Installing the
optional package does not enable anything on its own.

`--xdna` works by setting `COLI_XDNA=1` for the engine, and the engine reads that
variable directly — so if you export it yourself it has the same effect, with or
without the flag. That is the only other way in.

## What runs on the NPU

Only the **MoE shared-expert gate/up projection** for GLM
(`K=6144, N=2048`, fmt=4 grouped int4, group size 64), and only at sequence
lengths the qualified artifacts cover:

| rows per call | runs on |
|---|---|
| 1 – 64 | NPU, M64 artifact |
| 65 – 256 | NPU, M256 artifact |
| more than 256 | normal path |

Everything else — the down projection, routed experts, attention, every other
model — uses the normal path. Any operation the lane does not support, and any
runtime failure, falls back to the exact computation the engine performs
without this backend.

## Precision

The NPU path converts activations and weights to BF16 and accumulates in F32.
This is **not** the same arithmetic as the normal path, and it is not claimed to
be equivalent:

- per-option scores on a small internal benchmark changed on every operation the
  NPU handled;
- in a separate experiment with free-running generation, 5 of 8 prompts produced
  **different text**.

Whether that matters for your use is a judgement you have to make. The mode
exists so the choice is explicit.

## Installing the optional package

The NPU backend needs two things beside the executable: a helper DLL and the
qualified kernel artifacts. They ship as a separate optional download, not in
the main archive.

Extract it over your colibrì directory so the layout is:

```
<colibri directory>\
    colibri.exe
    coli_xdna.dll
    xdna\
        wa_F3_M64_K6144_N2048.xclbin
        wa_F3_M64_K6144_N2048_insts.bin
        wa_F3_M256_K6144_N2048.xclbin
        wa_F3_M256_K6144_N2048_insts.bin
```

Both locations are resolved **relative to the executable**, by absolute path.
`PATH` and the working directory are not searched, so the package has to be in
that one place. Every artifact is checked against a hash built into the binary
before it is used.

## What the optional package needs installed

The sidecar is small because it ships only the helper and the kernels. Two
things have to already be on the machine for `coli_xdna.dll` to load:

- **AMD XRT runtime** (`xrt_coreutil.dll`), from AMD's Ryzen AI / XRT install.
- **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** (x64). The helper is built with MSVC
  — that is how it reaches XRT's C++ interface — so it imports `MSVCP140.dll`,
  `VCRUNTIME140.dll` and `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`.

Neither is bundled. If either is missing the helper simply will not load, and
`--xdna` reports it and continues on the normal path:

```
[XDNA] requested, and the artifact package is valid, but the XDNA helper
       (coli_xdna.dll) is not usable beside the executable: continuing on the
       normal path
```

**The ordinary colibrì host needs neither of these.** It imports only Windows
system libraries, with or without the NPU capability compiled in — the external
dependencies belong to the optional package alone.

Also required: Windows and an XDNA2-class NPU.

## When something is missing

`--xdna` always tells you what happened and always keeps running on the normal
path:

```
[XDNA] requested, but this build has no XDNA support: continuing on the normal path
[XDNA] requested, but the XDNA package was not found at <dir>\xdna: continuing on the normal path
[XDNA] requested, but the XDNA package is incomplete (missing <file>) in <dir>\xdna: ...
[XDNA] requested, but an XDNA artifact does not match its expected hash (<file>):
       refusing to use it, continuing on the normal path
[XDNA] requested, and the artifact package is valid, but the XDNA helper
       (coli_xdna.dll) is not usable beside the executable: ...
```

An artifact whose bytes do not match the expected hash is refused even though
you asked for the NPU — bytes that are not the qualified bytes are not the
qualified kernel.

When everything is in place you get the activation notice instead, once:

```
[XDNA] experimental: qualified GLM shared expert operations will use the
[XDNA] native NPU with a reduced-precision BF16 compute path. Model output
[XDNA] may differ from the normal path, and generated text has been observed
[XDNA] to diverge. Operations this lane does not support continue to use the
[XDNA] normal path.
```

All of this goes to stderr, so it never mixes into machine-readable output.


## Producing the optional package (maintainers)

CI cannot build this package. The helper needs the XRT SDK and the artifacts
need the AIE toolchain, and the release runners have neither — which is why the
Windows job builds an XDNA-capable host and stops there. The sidecar is produced
on a qualified machine and attached to the same release.

Everything below is owned by `c/tools/build_xdna_package.py`. It reads the
expected artifact names and hashes out of `c/backend_xdna.c`, so the package can
never drift from what the engine will accept at runtime.

```bash
python tools/build_xdna_package.py \
    --helper   <path to the built coli_xdna.dll> \
    --artifacts <directory holding the four qualified artifacts> \
    --out      dist/xdna-pkg \
    --release --dist dist
```

That verifies every input against the compiled registry *before* writing
anything, then produces three files named from `version.py`:

```
colibri-<tag>-windows-x86_64-xdna.zip            the sidecar
colibri-<tag>-windows-x86_64-xdna.manifest.txt   sizes, hashes, roles, version
colibri-<tag>-windows-x86_64-xdna.sha256         sha256sum format
```

The name keeps the core archive's stem and adds `-xdna`, so it sits beside
`colibri-<tag>-windows-x86_64.zip`, is matched by the release job's own
`sha256sum colibri-*`, and cannot be mistaken for the core download.

The archive is reproducible: the same helper and the same qualified artifacts
produce the same bytes, and therefore the same sha256, wherever they were staged
from and whatever mtimes those files carry. If you rebuild the sidecar and the
checksum moves, something in the *content* changed — that is a signal, not noise.

Before publishing, re-verify the built assets:

```bash
python tools/build_xdna_package.py --verify-release dist/colibri-<tag>-windows-x86_64-xdna.zip
```

This refuses to pass if the archive does not match its manifest, if the manifest
names a different release version than the file does, or if any artifact digest
disagrees with the compiled registry. Attach only after it prints `release
assets OK` — the command to do so is printed by `--release`, and uses the same
`gh release upload ... --clobber` the release workflow itself uses.

**Never bundle** `xrt_core.dll`, `xrt_coreutil.dll`, the MSVC redistributable, the
AIE toolchain or any SDK header. Those are the user's to install; the sidecar is
only colibrì's own helper and artifacts.

To confirm the ordinary download is unaffected, install the core archive on its
own and run normally: no helper is loaded, no device is opened, and nothing
about the default path changes.

## What this backend does not do

- It is not enabled by having the hardware, the helper, or the package.
- It does not choose between the NPU and the normal path on speed or cost.
- No speed claim is made here.
- It does not extend to other models or other operations.
