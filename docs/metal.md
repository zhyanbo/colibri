# Metal backend (Apple Silicon, experimental)

On Apple Silicon the decode profile is matmul-bound, and unified memory removes
the PCIe copy tax that keeps CUDA's streaming experts on the CPU — so colibrì
has an opt-in Metal backend that runs the **routed-expert SwiGLU (batched,
zero-copy from the RAM slabs)**, the **fused decode attention** (full MLA layer
in one command buffer, S≤4), and **prefill's large GEMMs** on the GPU.
Decode is token-exact vs the CPU path. Prefill's large GEMMs run on the GPU in a
different accumulation order, so on **near-tie logits** they can occasionally pick a
different top token than the CPU — a floating-point ordering difference, not a kernel
bug (`make metal-test` passes the GEMM at ~3e-6 against a 1e-4 tolerance; see
[#622](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/622)). It is invisible in normal use
but can surface in teacher-forced oracle comparisons on pathological 4-bit toy
containers. Set `COLI_METAL_GEMM_MIN=100000` to keep every GEMM on the CPU for
bit-exact prefill (`DEBUG_LOGITS=1` on a `TF=1` run dumps the top-5 logits and the
top1–top2 margin at each mismatch, so you can see how close the tie was).

`COLI_METAL_PREFILL=1` extends the fused attention to **prefill** (S>4): the whole
attention — projections, scores, softmax, value, output — runs on the GPU in one
command buffer instead of the CPU. On a 544-token prompt this cuts prefill attention
~4x (35.9 s → 9.0 s). It is **off by default**: like the prefill GEMM above, the GPU
accumulates in a different order and can pick a different top token on near-tie logits
(same [#622](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/622) family), so a greedy stream
is not guaranteed bit-identical to the CPU — on natural prompts it stays consistent, on
pathological repetitive prompts an early token can flip. Turn it on when prefill latency
matters more than exact CPU parity; prompts past the single-dispatch thread cap fall
back to the CPU automatically.

```bash
cd c
make colibri METAL=1          # macOS only; no Xcode needed (shader compiles at runtime)
                              # any macOS SDK builds; the COLI_METAL_RESSET residency-set
                              # path needs the macOS 15 SDK and is compiled out below it
make metal-test           # standalone kernel/attention correctness vs CPU reference
COLI_METAL=1 COLI_MODEL=/path/glm52_i4 ./coli chat --ram 96
```

The release's `macos-arm64.tar.gz` has `colibri`, `inkling` and `kimi_k3` built
with `METAL=1`: `COLI_METAL=1` (`K3_METAL=1` for Kimi K3) turns the backend on
with nothing to build, and without it they run on the CPU as before.

Measured on an M4 Max (128 GB, warm cache, MTP on): CPU 0.30 → Metal
**0.42 tok/s (~1.4×)** (best config adds `DIRECT=1`; ~3× vs this machine's
first cold run). An M5 Max with a 46.9 GB learned pin reached **2.06 tok/s**
([#103](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/103); see also the
[M5 Max performance report](METAL-M5MAX-PERF-REPORT.md)).

Key design points: Metal's ~5 ms submit latency makes per-matmul dispatch a
loss — everything is batched into few command buffers per layer, and the
resident experts' GPU work is submitted *before* the missed experts' disk reads
so I/O and compute overlap. `COLI_METAL_GEMM_MIN` tunes the prefill GEMM row
threshold (default 16). Streaming, cache, MTP, DSA and the persistence formats
are unchanged; every GPU path falls back to the CPU per-block on any fault.
Numerics are dequant→f32-MAC (same as the CUDA tier); greedy outputs are
byte-identical to the CPU engine.
